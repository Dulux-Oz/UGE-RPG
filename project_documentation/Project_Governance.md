# Project Governance

Version 0.1

This document is all about how we run the Project: who's in charge, how things are decided, and how things are done.

## Current Governance Framework

At the moment the Project runs under a ["Benevolent Dictator" Model](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/project_documentation/BD_Model.md), in the same way that most RPG groups have their GM acting as a "Benevolent Dictator".

Our "Benevolent Dictator" (BD) at the moment is our Project Founder.

## Planned Governance Framework

It is expected that, once the Project has grown and matured, we will move towards a ["Consensus-Based Democracy" Model](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/project_documentation/CBD_Model.md) of Project Governance.

Under the "Consensus-Based Democracy" Model of project governance there will come a time when a consensus cannot be reached. The fall-back position in such a case is to have a [vote](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/project_documentation/Voting.md).

## "Project Officers"

A Project such as ours requires a few different "Project Officers;" individuals who perform specific, sensitive jobs for the Project to help it run smoothly and achieve the Projects [goals](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/project_documentation/Mission_Statement.md).
