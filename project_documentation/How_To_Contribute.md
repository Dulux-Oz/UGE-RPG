# How To Contribute (0.1)

First of all, let us say both "Thank you" and "Welcome!" Like most Open Source projects we're only as good as our Contributors and we rely on them - on you - to keep this Project alive and growing!

You're here (we hope) because you're excited about joining us in developing the Übergame Role-Playing Game and the Übergame Engine - or at the very least interested in finding out how you can help. As we said elsewhere, the Project needs all sorts of people with all sorts of skills: Artists, Cartographers, Rules Developers, Programmers, Editors, Proofreaders, Translators, Testers, Lawyers, Publishers, and many others. So no-matter what your particular skill-set is or what interests you, we've got a place for you! And even if you feel as if you don't have any useful skills but want to help out anyway, then you can find a place here in the Project.

This "How To" document is simply the first in a series of related documents all explaining how you can contribute to the Project. No, you won't have to read them all, because different documents explain different part of the Project so that different people can get the information they need to contribute to the parts of the Project they're interested in. We've broken things up like this so that each piece of information is relevant, easily digestible, and focussed on the parts of the project you're interested in.

The Project natural falls into a number of sub-projects, and each sub-project will natural appeal to different people. The first sub-project concerns the development of the UGE itself. This is where the Artists, Rules Developers, Proofreaders and Editors, and others, will natural gravitate.

The second sub-project (or is that sub-projects) is the development of each of the Übergame Settings and Rules Modules. Again, it will be the Artists, Rules Developers, Proofreaders and Editors who'll be drawn here, along with the Cartographers and others. Each Setting will almost certainly form as its own sub-project, but we expect plenty of "cross pollination" among all these groups.

The next major sub-project is the development of the Fantasy Grounds&trade; UGE Ruleset. This is where the Programmers and Testers will find themselves, but the Artists, Cartographers, Proofreaders, Editors and others will also find plenty of things to do here as well.

Hand-in-hand with the development of the UGE Ruleset will be the development of the various Settings into Fantasy Grounds&trade; Extensions and Modules (and possible Rulesets as well). Again, it'll be the Programmers and Testers who will find themselves drawn to these parts of the Project, along with the artists and others.

Finally, there are the Translators. It is these people who will take the work of all the others and translate everything into their own chosen language or languages.

In addition to all of the above are the common parts of all the sub-projects - things like the Project Governance, Code Of Conduct, and the various Standards and Project-wide How To's.

All of the Project Documentation is listed below in logical groupings, so read the ones you need to (and the others that you want to) and find out how to effectively contribute to the Project.
