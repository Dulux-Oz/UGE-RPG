# File Locations (0.1)

The Project is broken up into a number of folders to help both us and you locate the relevant information quickly and efficiently.

 - If you're looking for the information about the Project itself you'll find it in the [**project_documentation**](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/tree/master/project_documentation) folder.
 - The [**support_files**](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/tree/master/support_files) folder contains miscellaneous files use by the Project that probably won't be of interest to anyone but our die-hard fans.
 - Once they're up to an appropriate standard, it is within the **releases** folder that you'll find the Ãœbergame Engine Role-Playing Game manuscripts (in pdf form) and the Fantasy Grounds UGE-RPG Ruleset (.pak), Extensions (.ext) and Modules (.mod).
 - Working versions of the UGE-RPG Manuscript files can be found in the **uge_manuscript** folder.
 - Working versions of the UGE-RPG Ruleset files can be found in the **uge_ruleset** folder.
 - Working versions of translations of all of the Project's files into different languages can be found in the **translations** folder.
 - Working versions of individual Setting Manuscripts can be found in their individual folders, always named as follows: **[setting]_manuscript**
 - Working versions of individual Setting Rulesets, Extensions and/or Modules can be found in their individual folders, always named as follows: **[setting]_[ruleset|extension|module]**
