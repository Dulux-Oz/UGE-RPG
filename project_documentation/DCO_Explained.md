# Developer Certificate Of Origin Explained

Version 1.0.0

## Signing your work

Before we can include your contribution in the UGE-RPG Project, you need to give us your permission.

As the author of any creative work (including source code or documentation), you control the copyright for that work. The UGE-RPG Project can't legally use your contribution unless you allow us to.

To manage this process, the UGE-RPG Project uses a mechanism called a *Developer Certificate Of Origin (DCO)* popularised by The Linux Foundation. The DCO is a legally binding statement that asserts that you are the creator of your contribution, and that you license the work under the Licenses used by the UGE-RPG Project as outlined in the Project's [**LICENSE**](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/LICENSE.md) Document.

To indicate that you agree to the terms of the DCO, you 'sign off' your contribution by adding a line with your name and e-mail address to every Git commit message.

- Example Signed-off-by: Matthew J Black - matthew@peregrineit.net

You must use your real name (no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions are allowed.)

Your signature certifies that you are either the author of the contribution or have the right to submit it under the open-source licenses used by the UGE-RPG Project.
