Select the files you wish to [stage](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/project_documentation/How_To_Stage_A_Change.md), and click on any files you wish to review.

When youâ€™re ready, type your message and hit the green `Commit` button to commit your changes.

The graph will update with your commit.

The equivalent Git CLI Commands are:

~~~
git checkout -b some-feature
# Edit some code

~~~
