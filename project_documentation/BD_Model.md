# The Benevolent Dictator Model

Version 1.0.0

The **Benevolent Dictator Model** is exactly what it sounds like: final decision-making authority rests with one person, who, by virtue of personality and experience, is expected to use it wisely.

Although "Benevolent Dictator" (or BD) is the standard term for this role, it would be better to think of it as "community-approved arbitrator" or "judge". Generally, Benevolent Dictators do not actually make all the decisions, or even most of the decisions. It's unlikely that one person could have enough expertise to make consistently good decisions across all areas of the project, and anyway, quality Contributors won't stay around unless they have some influence on the project's direction. Therefore, Benevolent Dictators 
commonly do not dictate much. Instead, they let things work themselves out through discussion and experimentation whenever possible. They participate in those discussions themselves, but as regular Contributors, often deferring to an area maintainer who has more  expertise. Only when it is clear that no consensus can be reached, and that most of the group wants someone to guide the decision so that development can move on, does she put her foot down and say "This is the way it's going to be." Reluctance to make decisions by fiat is a trait shared by almost all successful Benevolent Dictators; it is one of the reasons they manage to keep the role.
