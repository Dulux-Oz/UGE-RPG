# Getting Started

Version 1.0.0

To fully participate in the UGE-RPG Project you need to set up your working copy of the Git repository and the tools necessary to work with the Project.

## 1. Create A GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub Account you will need to create one. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for an account.

## 2. Fork The Project's Repository

See [How To Fork The Project](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/project_documentation/How_To_Fork_The_Project.md)

## 3. Install GitKraken

1. Create a suitable working folder on your computer (eg `c:/UGE-RPG-local`).
2. Download GitKraken - [www.gitkraken.com/download](https://www.gitkraken.com/download)
3. Run the installer.
4. Launch GitKraken (*Unleash the KRAKEN!*).

That's it - no Git tools are required for GitKraken, so once you've run the installer, you can open the app and get going.

GitKraken works directly with your repositories with no dependencies â€” you don't even need to have Git installed on your system.

## 4. Connect GitKraken To GitHub

1. In the top right-hand corner of the GitKraken window, click on the `Settings` Menu-Button and choose `Preferences`. ![GitKrack Settings Menu](https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/integrations/github/preferences.png)
2. From the Authentication window, select GitHub.com and then hit the green `Connect to GitHub` button. ![GitKraken GitHub Connect](https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/integrations/github/preferences-authentication.png)
3. Enter in your GitHub Username and Password.
4. Click on the green `Generate SSH key and add to GitHub` Button. ![](https://support.gitkraken.com/img/documentation/integrations/github/generate-ssh.png)
5. In the top left-hand corner, click the "Exit Preferences" Button.

## 5. Clone Your Public Server-Side Repository

See [How To Clone A Repository](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/project_documentation/How_To_Clone_A_Repository.md)

## 6. (Optional) Set Up A Gravatar

In GitKraken's `Preferences`, under `Profiles` you may like to modify your profile details, including your GitKraken Avatar. If you'd like to use a custom Avater, then both GitKraken and GitHub can both use a *Gravatar* (Globally Recognized Avatar). You can set up a Gravatar on the Gravatar Website [gravatar.com](https://gravatar.com).
