This chapter is of interest to everybody: Players, GMs and Developers. It ties in closely with the next two chapters as well and all three chapters should be considered together when designing *Übergame* Settings and Rule Modules.

## Introduction

All RPGs are about telling stories: stories about characters, stories about the creatures that characters encounter and interact with and stories about what the characters do; *Übergame* is no different. All characters and creatures in the stories we tell need a way to be described in terms of how strong, quick, smart or wise they are and just about every RPG does this by way of assigning Abilities to their creatures. In *Übergame* characters and the monsters/aliens they inevitably end up fighting are described by seven main or Primary Abilities: *Strength*, *Dexterity*, *Constitution*, *Intelligence*, *Wisdom*, *Charisma* and *Looks*. These are not the only way to describe creatures as creatures also have a range of Secondary and Tertiary Abilities which we'll talk about later, but these four *Physical Abilities* (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution and Looks) and three *Mental Abilities* (Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma) form the foundation of the creatures that make up the fauna (and flora) of the *Übergame's* various worlds (Settings).

Every *Übergame* Setting needs a "benchmark" creature to use as the basis to describe every other creature that exists in the Setting. The benchmark creature used by just about all *Übergame*s is the plain, normal or *Standard Human Being*.

The Primary Abilities for a Standard Human are all scored on a scale from negative 5 (`-5`) to positive 5 (`+5`). The scores for other creatures can certainly go higher and/or lower than this range and a "super" Human (such as in a Superhero setting) can certainly have scores above this range as well, but for most *Übergame* Settings this "normal" range of `-5` to `+5` works very well for Humans and other, similar species designed to be used as Player Characters. We call this number for any given Primary Ability an *Ability Score*. The Human average for an Ability Score is `0`, with exceptionally talented individuals (such as the Player Characters) potentially having an Ability Score of `+4` or possibly even `+5`. Ability Scores higher than `+5` are normally only found in monsters, aliens, superheroes or in the various beings commonly known as gods.

Each of the seven Ability Scores has a direct effect of some aspect of a creature's performance, adding to or subtracting from the various Die Rolls that make up the Game Mechanics of *Übergame* and the *Übergame* Settings.

## The Seven Primary Abilities

### Strength (STR)

Strength (abbreviated *STR*) is a measure of how physically strong a creature is. It is pure muscle power; Warriors and others who wish to swing big swords or large damage weapons and wear lots of armour need a high Strength Score.

A creature's Strength Score is generally added to:

- The Attack Roll in hand-to-hand combat (known as Melee Combat) - the Melee THAC0 and the Grapple THAC0.
- The Damage Roll of Melee Weapons and some Ranged Weapons (those weapons that rely on the strength of the user to do damage).
- Skill Checks that are based on Strength, such as Climb, Jump and Swim.
- Any Die Roll where physical strength is a factor.

### Dexterity (DEX)

Dexterity (abbreviated *DEX*) measures hand-eye coordination, balance, reflexes and agility. This Ability is the most important for Rogues and other Scoundrels who rely of being deft with their hands or who must have a very good balance, etc. It is also important for those creatures who want to be good with Ranged Weapons such as bows, crossbows, personal firearms and lasers and for those who don't or can't wear heavy armour so that they can dodge out of the way of incoming attacks.

A creature's Dexterity Score is generally added to:

- The Attack Roll in Ranged Combat - the Ranged THAC0.
- The Armour Class of the creature, provided they can react to a given attack or are not weighed down with too much armour or equipment.
- The Reflex Saving Throw.
- Skill Checks that require hand-eye coordination or agility, such as Balance, Open Mechanical Locks and Tumble.
- Any Die Roll where physical agility is a factor.

### Constitution (CON)

Constitution (abbreviated *CON*) is used to represent the overall health, vitality and stamina of a creature. A Secondary Ability (Hit Points) measures how much combat damage a creature can absorb before dying and as Constitution has an effect on this Secondary Ability it is important for all creatures.

A creature's Constitution Score is generally added to:

- Each Hit Die a creature has for extra Hit Points.
- The Fortitude Saving Throw.
- Skill Checks that are based on Constitution, such as Concentration and Stabilise Self.
- The maximum number of times a creature can be bought back from the dead (when a given Setting allows this).
- Any Die Roll where physical stamina is a factor.

### Intelligence (INT)

Intelligence (abbreviated *INT*) determines how well a creature learns and reasons. Intelligence is important for any creature who wants to have a good selection of Skills. When using the Magic Rule Module Intelligence is important for those creatures using Arcane Magic because it affects how many Hexes they can Cast, how hard their Hexes are to resist and how powerful their Hexes can be.

A creature's Intelligence Score is generally added to:

- The number of Sill Points gained at each Primary Class Level.
- Skill Checks that require pure smarts or memory, such as Knowledge Skills, Open Electronic Locks, Search and (when using the Magic Rule Module) Magecraft.
- Any Die Roll where mental agility is a factor.

### Wisdom (WIS)

Wisdom (abbreviated *WIS*) describes a creature's willpower, mental strength, common sense, perception and intuition. While Intelligence represents a creature's ability to analyse information, Wisdom is more related to being in tune with and aware of one's surroundings. An "absent-minded professor" almost certainly has high Intelligence but often low Wisdom, while a simpleton might have low Intelligence but may posses great common sense (high Wisdom). Wisdom is the most important Primary Ability if a character desires keen senses and a high Wisdom Score is a must for those using Divine Magic from the Magic Rule Module. It is also important for the move divinely influenced Warriors as well.

A creature's Wisdom Score is generally added to:

- The Will Saving Throw.
- Skill Checks requiring willpower or perception, such as Heal, Spot and Listen.
- Any Die Roll where mental strength is a factor.

### Charisma (CHR)

Charisma (abbreviated *CHR*) measures a creature's force of personality, persuasiveness, personal magnetism and ability to lead. It represents actual strength of personality, not merely how one is perceived by others. Charisma is most important for those wising to influence others (including influencing or Turning the Undead), such as Holy Warriors, Priests, Diplomats and Entertainers and those wishing to lead others.

A creature's Charisma Score is generally added to:

- Checks to influence others, including Undead and other Turning Checks.
- The Looks Primary Ability Score.
- Skill Checks relying on force of personality, such as Bluff, Deception and Disguise.
- Any Die Roll where force of personality is a factor.

### Looks (LOK)

Looks (abbreviated *LOK*) reflects the personal beauty, social grace and physical attractiveness of a creature. It is used primarily to determine the initial reactions of others.

A creature's Looks Score is generally added to:

- Initial Reaction Checks.
- Any Die Roll where physical grace and beauty is a factor.

###### From The UGE-RPG Team

![UGE-RPG Symbol](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/support_files/übersymbol_medium.png) We once read (somewhere on the Internet) the following explanation of the "standard" Abilities using a Tomato (we added the one for Looks):

- Strength is the ability to crush a tomato.
- Dexterity is the ability to dodge a tomato.
- Constitution is the ability to eat a bad tomato.
- Intelligence is knowing a tomato is a fruit.
- Wisdom is knowing *NOT* to put a tomato in a fruit salad.
- Charisma is being able to sell a tomato-based fruit salad.
- Looks is the ability *NOT* to get a tomato thrown at you.

### Interactions Between Charisma And Looks

Charisma and Looks are very closely related: a creature's Looks is influenced by their Charisma, as physical attractiveness is influenced by how attractive a person's personality is.

One-half of a creature's Charisma Score is added to their base Looks Score and anything that effects a creature's Charisma Score will also effect their Looks Score (although only by half as much). So, for example, if a character's Charisma Score drops by two then their Looks Score will also drop, but only by one.

## Partial Ability Scores

It is possible, but unusual, for an Ability Score to have a fractional or decimal part (For Example: A Strength of `+3.5` or an Intelligence of `+1.2`). When an Ability Score has a fractional part such as this the fractional part is ignored in all cases, unless a specific rule states otherwise. In other words, a character is no better off (in most cases) having an Ability Score of `+2.9` than they are of having an Ability Score of `+2`; both are treated as a Score of `+2`.

## Karma

We'll talk about Karma in detail in Chapter XX, but we need to mention it briefly here now as well. Karma is a measure of how a person's intent and deeds influence that person's future. In *Übergame* it is closely related to luck, destiny and fate and to the cosmic forces that somehow surround powerful or special individuals (such as Player Characters and their nemesi). In game terms Player Characters use their Karma Points to influence events, such as die rolls and even death.

We mention this now because the same system that creatures use to determine their Ability Scores is also used to determine the creature's Karma Score (for those creatures special enough to have a Karma Score).

## Determining Ability And Karma Scores

A Player Character's Ability Scores and their Karma Score are determined by a mixture of player design and random chance, with the player determining how much random chance will be applied to their character's scores.

When designing creatures a Developer or GM can assign whatever Ability Scores they deem appropriate for the given creature, using the Standard Human as a guide (ie is the creature stronger or weaker than a Human, smarter or less intelligent, etc).

When creating a character the player is normally given 30 Build Points to spend on either "purchasing" Ability Score Points and Karma Score Points or on "purchasing" Ability And Karma Score Die Rolls. This is done as outlined below.

30 Build Points provides for mildly heroic Player Characters. If the Developer or the GM wants highly heroic Player Characters then the players can start with more Build Points. For Superhero Settings it is suggested that the Player Characters should start with XX Build Points.

~~~
[How many for a Superhero game?]
~~~

Determining a character's Ability Scores is done as follows:

First, all seven of a character's Ability Scores start at -2, while their Karma Score starts at 0.

To improve an Ability Score by one Ability Point the player must spend a number of Build Points equal to the current Ability Score they are improving or 1 Build Point, whichever is greater. For example: To improve an Ability Score from `-2` to `-1` costs 1 Build Point; to improve an Ability Score from `+3` to `+4` costs 3 Build Points.

Purchasing Karma Points is even simpler: each Karma Point costs 3 Build Points.

These costs are shown on Table 4-1: Ability And Karma Score Costs, below.

###### Table 4-1: Ability And Karma Score Costs

|Ability Score|Cost To Increase|Cumulative Cost|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|-2|0|0|
|-1|1|1|
|+0|1|2|
|+1|1|3|
|+2|2|4|
|+3|3|6|
|+4|4|9|
|Karma|3|3/Point|

For most *Übergame* Settings during character creation an Ability Score can not be raised above `+4`, nor can the Karma Score be raised above `4`.

Players are allowed to spend Build Points to have a partial Ability Score but not a partial Karma Score (For example: Spending only one Build Point to improve an Ability Score from `+2` to `+2.5`). There is no immediate advantage in doing this, but Player Characters can earn a few extra Build Points as they become more powerful and experienced and some Player Characters in some Settings (for example: Blackguards, Knights and Paladins from the *Übergame: Jägerwyrm* Setting) can also earn partial Ability Score Points for some Abilities as they become more powerful and experienced.

As an alternative to purchasing Ability Score Points and Karma Score Points, players can spend 1 Build Point to "purchase" an *Ability And Karma Score Die Roll*. An Ability And Karma Score Die Roll is a roll of `1d8`, with the result determining which of the character's Ability Scores is increased by 1 or if the Karma Score is increased by 1, as shown on Table 4-2: Ability And Karma Score Die Roll Results, below. For most Settings, if the Ability or Karma Score indicated by the Ability And Karma Score Die Roll is already at `+4` or `4`, respectively, then the player can choose which of the remaining seven Scores to increase by 1. Remember that at this stage in the process of determine Ability and Karma Scores for most *Übergame* Settings no Ability Score can be increased above `+4` and the Karma Score cannot be increased above `4`.

###### Table 4-2: Ability And Karma Score Die Roll Results

|1d8|Ability|
|:-:|:-:|
|1|Strength|
|2|Dexterity|
|3|Constitution|
|4|Intelligence|
|5|Wisdom|
|6|Charisma|
|7|Looks|
|8|Karma|

Once a player has spent all of their Build Points and made all of their Ability And Karma Score Die Rolls the *Species Ability And Karma Score Bonus And Penalties* (see below) for the player's chosen Species are applied. These bonuses may increase an Ability Score above `+4` or the Karma Score above `4` (or whatever the given *Übergame* Setting's maximums are), but the Species *Ability And Karma Score Maximums* (see below) for the player's chosen Species must be obeyed.

Finally, the Player Character must add one-half of their final Charisma Score (including any fractions) to their Looks Score (see *Interactions Between Charisma And Looks*, above).

So, which is the "best" way to determine a character's Ability and Karma Scores? Well, it depends upon how much control the player wants over the process. At one extreme some players carefully allocate all of their Build Points (30 in most cases) to purchasing Ability and Karma Points, optimising their character's Abilities to just the way they want them. At the other end of the spectrum some players allocate all of their Build Points to Ability And Karma Score Die Rolls, letting chance play its part and hoping for lucky rolls.

Most players prefer to take a middle ground: they allocate their Build Points to meeting the minimum requirements for the most important Abilities relevant to their chosen Class or Classes (see Chapter XX - Professions) and then spend any remaining Build Points on Ability And Karma Score Die Rolls, happy to let Lady Luck have her say as well.

Astute players will realise that it is best to allocate Build Points to Ability And Karma Score Die Rolls after purchasing Ability and Karma Points because of the greater potential "bang for your buck" a lucky Ability And Karma Score Die Roll may have. For example: If a character's Wisdom Score is `+3` it costs 3 Build Points to increase it to `+4`, but it only costs 1 Build Point to purchase an Ability And Karma Score Die Roll, which if the character's player rolls a `5` means that the character can increase their Wisdom from `+3` to `+4` for only 1 Build Point; similarly if you roll an Ability that is already at `+4` (or the Setting maximum) and choose to allocate the Ability Point to the character's Wisdom. The down-side, of course, is that you may not roll a `5` or an already maximised Ability Score.

## Modifying The Ability Score Build Process

All of the above rules are designed to produce balanced, suitable characters for "mildly heroic" style games. We have found over the years that a "mildly heroic" set of characters provides the best stories for just about all genres and Settings, from Fantasy to Wild West to Modern to Post Apocalyptic to Space Opera and beyond.

However, some GM's and Players might prefer to tell "highly heroic" stories. Superhero and similar settings also require characters that are "highly heroic" in nature as well. So how does the *Übergame* cater to these types of games?

Well, there are three fundamental ways that the Ability Score Rule Module can be modified to cater for this. The first is by increasing (or decreasing) the number of Build Points players have to create their character. The second way is to increase (or decrease) the starting Ability Point Scores. The third way is to increase (or decrease) the Maximum Limit of starting Ability Scores; you will probably have to do this anyway if you decide to modify the Ability Score Rule Module with either of the other two methods.

Increasing the number of Build Points seems the simplest way to modify things. Be aware, however, that if you increase the number of Build Points you will invariably end up with characters that have one or two Abilities that are exceptional and the rest will be about average.

If you prefer to have all the character's Abilities significantly above the norm, then it might be a better idea to adjust the starting Ability Scores instead of increasing the number of Build Points. Doing this keeps the range of Ability Scores nearly the same but all of the Scores will be clustered around a different average. Let's take a look at how this works using some real numbers.

In a standard *Übergame* a player can spend all of their 30 Build Points to end up with three Ability Scores of `+2`, four Scores of `+1` and a Karma Score of `2`; or six Ability Scores of `+2`, one Score of `+1` and a Karma Score of `1`. We can treat these two sets of Ability and Karma Scores as "average" for player characters. The minimum an Ability Score could be is `-2` while the maximum would be `+4`. This is shown as Characters One and Two on Table 4-3: Sample Character Ability Scores, below.

If instead the players have 45 Build Points and the Ability Score Maximums were raised to `+5`, a character could have four Ability Scores of `+3`, three Scores of `+1` and a Karma of `4`; or six Ability Scores of `+3`, one Score of `+1` and a Karma of `2`. The minimum an Ability Score could be is still `-2` while the maximum would be `+5`. This is shown as Characters Three and Four on Table 4-3: Sample Character Ability Scores, below.

On the other hand, instead of increasing the number of Build Points by 15 from 30 to 45, if the starting Ability Score was raised from `-2` to `0` (an effective increase of 14 Build Points) and the Ability Score Maximums were raised to `+5`, a character could have five Ability Scores of `+3`, two Scores of `+2` and a Karma of `2`; or four Ability Scores of `+4`, three Scores of `+1` and a Karma of `1`. The minimum an Ability Score could be is `0` while the maximum would be `+5`. This is shown as Characters Five and Six on Table 4-3: Sample Character Ability Scores, below.

###### Table 4-3: Sample Character Ability Scores

|Character|One|Two|Three|Four|Five|Six|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|STR|+2|+2|+3|+3|+3|+4|
|DEX|+2|+2|+3|+3|+3|+4|
|CON|+2|+2|+3|+3|+3|+4|
|INT|+1|+2|+3|+3|+3|+4|
|WIS|+1|+2|+1|+3|+3|+1|
|CHR|+1|+2|+1|+3|+2|+1|
|LOK|+1|+1|+1|+1|+2|+1|
|Karma|2|1|4|2|2|1|
|Build Points|30|30|45|45|30|30|
|Min Score|-2|-2|-2|-2|0|0|
|Max Score|+4|+4|+5|+5|+5|+5|

All of this shows that the Developer or GM really needs to map out how any changes to the Ability Score Rule Module will affect their game.

In all cases we strongly recommend that you don't modify the cost, starting value or maximum limit on Karma. Karma has a profound effect on the game: too much and the game becomes way too easy and thus gets boring very fast; too little and the game become frustrating and again very boring very fast. This isn't to say that you can't adjust the Karma Sub-System, just that you should have a very, very good understanding of how Karma works and affects the game before you go "playing around" with it.

## Species Ability And Karma Score Bonuses And Penalties

Each of the different Species in a given Setting eligible to become a character controlled by a player has different bonuses and penalties added to or subtracted from their Ability Scores. For example: In the *Übergame: Jägerwyrm* Setting Elves are generally not as robust physically as Humans (Elves have a Constitution Penalty) but are more nimble (Elves receive a Dexterity Bonus). Humans are taken as the norm or baseline for all other Species and apart from any special cases detailed in individual Settings Humans do not receive any bonuses or penalties to their Ability Scores. However, a standard *Übergame* rule is that only Humans have a bonus to their Karma Score (a +1 bonus).

The amount of Ability and Karma Score Bonus or Penalty a given Species receives is detailed in the individual Setting's Setting Book and is usually summarised on a table in the Setting Book.

Ability and Karma Score Bonuses and Penalties are applied to a character's final Ability and Karma Scores as the last step in determining the character's Ability and Karma Scores, after all other adjustments are made. However, players should keep in mind their chosen Species' Ability and Karma Score Bonuses and Penalties when determining their character's Ability and Karma Scores as they may have an influence on the player's decisions.

## Species Ability And Karma Score Maximums

Each of the different Species in a given Setting have different Ability and Karma Score Maximums. These are normally listed in the Setting's Setting Book on a table and normally include the Species Ability and Karma Score Bonuses and Penalties and the Charisma/Looks Bonus. If, during determining a character's Ability and Karma Scores an Ability or Karma Score does exceed the relevant maximum the Ability or Karma Score is lowered to the relevant maximum and any excess Ability or Karma Score Points are discarded.

## Increasing Ability Scores

Ability Scores can increase during an *Übergame* Campaign, normally when a character changes Grade (see Chapter XX - Professions).

Apart from potentially increasing a character's Ability Score when the character changes Grade, Ability Scores may only be increased when a given Rule Module and/or Setting specifies, such as using powerful magic or magic items (if playing with the Magic Rule Module) or "high" technological items (as described by a given Setting's Setting Book).

As a general rule, each use of such a method is only worth one Build Point each time it is used to increase an Ability Score and only if that Ability Score is below the Species Maximum for the character's Species; it will almost certainly require several Build Points and thus several uses of such a method to increase an Ability Score by a single point. For an Ability Score at the Species Maximum or above, each use of such a method is only worth 0.2 Build Points (i.e. five uses of such a method is required to generate one Build Point).

Karma, on the other hand, cannot be "purchased" by any method; it can only be earned as a result of changing Grade or by being awarded by the GM for performing particularly noteworthy deeds.

## What Do The Numbers Mean?

So now we know how to go about determining a creature's Ability Scores, what do the numbers actually *mean*?

The basic rule when talking about Ability Scores is that every point of Ability is half as much again as a Standard Human. For example: A creature with a Strength of `+2` is twice as strong as a Standard Human; a creature with an Intelligence of `+4` is three times as intelligent as a Standard Human; a creature with a Looks of `-2` is half as pretty (twice as ugly?) as a Standard Human.

We'll go into greater detail in regards to some of this later, but Table 4-4: Some Ability Score Comparisons, below, gives an example comparison of Ability Scores to an activity and a real-world measure, plus some demographic information around the number of people who have a given Ability Score. When looking at remember that it is describing "Standard Humans" and also that the numbers are rounded off; this is a game after all, not an exact model of real-life. Also remember that for most *Übergame* Settings the Player Characters are supposed to be "a little bit better" than an average, standard Human.

###### Table 4-4: Some Ability Score Comparisons

|Ability<br />Score|Strength<br />(Bench Press)|Intelligence<br />(IQ Equivalent)|% Of Population<br />With This Score|About 1<br />Person In X|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|-4|22-44 lb / 10-20 kg|32-46|0.02|5,000|
|-3|44-66 lb / 20-30 kg|47-61|0.6|167|
|-2|66-88 lb / 30-40 kg|62-76|6.1|17|
|-1|88-132 lb / 40-60 kg|77-91|24.2|4|
|0|132-176 lb / 60-80 kg|92-108|38.3|3|
|+1|176-264 lb / 80-120 kg |109-123|24.2|4|
|+2|264-352 lb / 120-160 kg|124-138|6.1|17|
|+3|352-440 lb / 160-200 kg|139-153|0.6|167|
|+4|440-528 lb / 200-240 kg|154-168|0.02|5,000|
|+5|528-616 lb / 240-280 kg|169-183|0.0003|333,333|


For Developers and GMs designing their own creatures they now have a series of "benchmarks" with which to assign to the creature's Ability Scores; all they have to ask themselves is "How many times more Strong (or Intelligent or Dexterous, etc) is this creature when compared to a Standard Human?" Is it twice as Strong? Then assign it a Strength of `+2`. Is it only one-and-a-half times as strong as a Standard Human? Assign it a Strength of `+1`, and so on.
