## Ability Scores, Grade And Bonus Spells
Depending upon a creatureâ€™s Ability Scores, a creature who's Primary Class is one that can Perform Miracles, Cast Hexes or Give Recitals (such a person is commonly referred to as a *Magecaster*) may gain extra Spell Slots for a high score in the appropriate Ability. The number of extra Spell Slots of each Spell Level that such an individual gains is equal to the score in the appropriate Primary Ability plus their Grade Number minus the Spell Level.  This information is given on Table X-1: Ability Scores, Grade And Bonus Spells, below.

###### Table X-1 - Ability Scores, Grade And Bonus Spells
|Ability Score + Grade|Spell Level 1|Spell Level 2|Spell Level 3|Spell Level 4|Spell Level 5|Spell Level 6|Spell Level 7|Spell Level 8|Spell Level 9|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|< +1|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|N/A|
|+1|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|
|+2|2|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|
|+3|3|2|1|0|0|0|0|0|0|
|+4|4|3|2|1|0|0|0|0|0|
|+5|5|4|3|2|1|0|0|0|0|
|+6|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|0|0|
|+7|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|0|
|+8|8|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|
|+9|9|8|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|
|+10|10|9|8|7|6|5|4|3|2|

- Even though Table X-1 - Ability Scores, Grade And Bonus Spells only includes Ability Scores+Grades up to +10 and Spell Slots up to 9<sup>th</sup> level, the progression continues infinitely in both directions. For Spell Slots above 9<sup>th</sup> level and for Ability Scores+Grades above +10, the table is expanded following the same pattern. Spell Slots above 9<sup>th</sup> level are used to hold Spells which have been modified by Metamagical Special Abilities.
