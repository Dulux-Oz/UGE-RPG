# *Übergame* Architecture

Version 0.1

> High achievement always takes place in the framework of high expectation. - Charles Kettering

> What we wish for, dream and imagine is the very framework and foundation of everything we create. - Cynthia Sue Larson

This chapter is written primarily for Developers. GMs will get a lot out of the information presented here too, as this chapter deals with how *Übergame* is able to cover every time period and every genre. Players also will find this information interesting; however, Players should not be too concerned if they get "lost in the details"; instead, they should rely on their GM to help them out and GMs in turn should rely on the author/Developer of the Setting(s) and/or Rule Module(s) that they are using to run their game.

## Eras

Let's just focus for a moment on the equipment that characters can use in an *Übergame*. Because *Übergame* has been designed to allow us to game in any time period and in any setting it means that all of the equipment in the game uses the same basic rules and needs to work together. It also means that it is possible to have a modern assault rifle appear in an Ancient Roman setting and it will work correctly according to the rules. However, unless you are playing some sort of Time Travelling or Alternate Reality game it doesn't make any sense for a Roman Legionnaire to have a modern 21<sup>st</sup> Century assault rifle.

*Übergame* handles this issue by using the idea of *Eras*. Every piece of equipment belongs to an Era. In fact, just about everything in *Übergame* belongs to an Era (sometimes more than one). There are Skills that belong to an Era (eg Spaceship Pilot), Talents that belong to an Era (eg Power Armour Operations) and even creatures that belong to an Era (eg Dinosaurs).

When playing an *Übergame* one of the things that needs to be specified in the Setting is both the Minimum and Maximum Era allowed in the game. This is known as the *Era Range*. Anything with an Era that falls outside this range is generally not allowed (but see the description on *Era Reclassifications*, below). When gaming with the *Fantasy Grounds UGE-RPG Ruleset* these are two of the Options that can be set to make sure non-Era-compliant things don't show up in the game.

Of course, just because a given thing matches the Era Range still doesn't mean that it can appear in the particular game you are playing: a Setting or the GM can always specify that a given thing is not allowed even if it does match the Era Range (or is allowed if it doesn't).

An Era covers a particular time period but Eras do not have rigid start and end dates. Instead, one Era tends to bleed into the next, so that it is possible to have early examples of a piece of equipment (for example) appearing near the end of the previous Era. An example of this is the jet-powered aircraft. Although these aircraft are most associated with the Era after World War II (after the late 1940s) early examples of jet-powered aircraft can and did appear in the skies during the later part of the War. Thus, an *Übergame* set during World Word II would not have jet-powered aircraft as common items, but the GM of such a game could use one as a nasty surprise for his players, for example.

Eras are numbered from 1 to 12 and are also given a name. Table 2-1: Eras, below, lists the Eras, their common name, the time period they cover and some  example settings for a game that could occur in that Era.

It is also possible for something from a given Era in one Setting to belong to another Era in another Setting. An example of this are Dinosaurs. Dinosaurs belong to Era 1, but many a story exists where cave men (Era 2) are hunting and being hunted by dinosaurs or even a big game hunter in 19<sup>th</sup> Century Africa (Era 7) encountering a lost valley of dinosaurs. There is nothing to stop a Setting Developer or a GM from reclassifying something from one Era to another to make their game Setting... more interesting.

## What Are Rule Modules?

As has been said previously, *Übergame* is a Modular RPG System. But what does this actually mean?

### The Common Elements Of All RPGs

All RPGs have a number of common elements, such as rules for characters, combat, species, creatures/monsters/aliens, equipment, special abilities and skills. Some RPGs are explicit in outlining rules in these areas, while others only imply them and their uses. Some RPGs don't even have all of these elements but the majority of RPGs do and *Übergame* is no different. These elements go into forming the Core Rule Modules of the *Übergame* and each *Übergame* Setting will have these Modules as part of their make-up.

### The Not-Common Elements Of RPGs

In addition to the Core Modules mentioned above, most RPGs have other elements that give them their particular flavour or style, such as Magic, Spaceships, Firearms, Mutations, Cyberware and Super Powers, to name but a few. These elements form *Übergame's* Optional Rule Modules.

### What Are Sub-Systems?

Some Rule Modules cover such a large topic that they themselves are made up of a number of sub-modules or *Sub-Systems*. As an example, the Magic Module has rules for different types of magic. All of these magic types follow the same basic rules for magic, but it is possible to use only a few or even one of the different types of magic and not all of them, if you prefer.

Sub-Systems also come in handy when a Rule Module effects other Rule Modules. For example: If you are using the Magic Module then this has an effect on the Character Module and so the Magic Module would have a Sub-System particularly focussed on the character aspect of magic. Similarly when you use the Magic and the Cyberware Modules together: how does magic effect cyberware and how does cyberware effect magic? Each Rule Module has a Sub-System dealing with how this Module interacts with the other.

A Setting Developer or a GM can choose which of these Optional Modules and Sub-Systems to use as they wish or even develop their own, unique Modules or Sub-Systems for a particular need or as a replacement for one of ours. As long as you follow the idea of the Basic Game Mechanic discussed previously and keep in mind how your Rule Module might effect others your Optional Module should work quite happily with our Modules and with other Developers' and GMs' Modules as well.

### Layered Rule Modules

It is possible for a Rule Module to be reliant on another Rule Module or Modules. Such a Rule Module is known as a *Child Module* and the Rule Module that the Child Module relies upon is known as a *Parent Module*. Parent Modules can have their own Parent Modules as well.

This is known a *Layering*.

It is considered proper form to explicitly state in a Rule Module's Introduction if the Module is a Child Module of any Parent Modules.

An example of a Parent-Child Module relationship is the Firearms Module: it is a Child Module of the Equipment Module. Thus, the Equipment Module is the Parent Module of the Firearms Module.

## What Are Settings?

Although extremely useful, the idea of Eras isn't enough to help determine what type of *Übergame* we are playing: for that we need a *Setting*. A Setting covers the style of the *Übergame* we are playing and often players and GMs use the term genre and setting interchangeably. A Setting, however, is more than just a genre; or, more accurately, a Setting is a formal *Übergame* description of a genre.

One way to think about Settings is like this: if the Rule Modules and the Eras are cooking ingredients, than a Setting is a recipe.

### What's In A Setting?

A Setting needs to contain descriptions of a number of things. As has been previously mentioned the Era Range needs be specified, along with which Rule Modules need to be used. Settings can also contain Optional Rule Modules themselves, along with Sub-Systems and other Rules and Rule Modifications particular to the setting concerned (such as Era Reclassifications, for example).

Also included are such things as the Setting's background or history, locations, personalities, equipment and other, similar items. The section on *Setting Book Layout*, below, covers this in more detail.

### Layered Settings

As with some Rule Modules having Parent and Child Modules, some Settings can be layered on top of other Settings. This allows Setting Developers and GMs to use previously created Settings and add to them without having to "re-invent the wheel".

An example of this is two popular cyberpunk settings found in two separate RPGs. One of these RPGs is a standard near-future cyberpunk setting with all of the aspects that you would expect in such a setting. The other RPG is like the first, but adds a magical element into this near-future cyberpunk mix. In the *Übergame* RPG System, the first RPG would be described as an *Übergame* Setting, while the second would be described as a Child Setting of the first.

### Setting Book Layout

To keep everything consistent within all the *Übergame* Books a standard layout is used for all Setting Books. That layout follows the Chapter Headings in this book, in the order that they appear in this book.

Sometimes a Setting won't have much to say about a particular topic covered by a Chapter Heading in this book. That's OK; simply include the Chapter Heading along with a brief note as to why there isn't much to say about that topic and move on. An example of this is a Gangster Setting: under the Magic Chapter Heading you would put something like "This Setting does not use magic."

Sometimes a Setting Books needs to include information that doesn't correspond to a chapter in this book. Again, that's OK; simply include the information in a new Appendix. This is particularly relevant for new Rule Modules.

If a Setting Book is a Child Setting of another Setting, then the Child Setting Book should follow the layout of the Parent Book.

The chapter in a Setting Book corresponding to this chapter would contain all the information on how the Setting is put together. Such things as the Era Range, the list of Rule Modules used (and excluded, if appropriate), any Parent Setting Books this Setting Book relies upon and any Era Reclassifications would appear in this corresponding chapter. It should be obvious what needs to go into the other chapters of a Setting Book. Use the *Übergame: Jägerwyrn* Setting Book or one of the other *Übergame* Setting Books as an example of how to lay out your own Setting Book.

## A "Rules Exception" Game

*Übergame* is built as a "Rules Exception" game; that is, a basic rule is given that will cover most relevant situations, and then various exceptions are given that "modify" the base rule in some way. A good example of this is the idea of a *Standard Human* (a concept that you'll find re-occurring time and time again throughout the *Übergame*): the Standard Human is taken as the basis for all Species, and then other Species are described in relation to the Standard Human (ie stronger/weaker, faster/slower, uglier or more beautiful, etc).

## The Game Mechanic Behind The Scenes

The underlying idea behind all of the various numbers, ratings, die rolls and everything else in the *Übergame* is: "What can our 'Standard Human' do?". This is the foundation of all of the design decisions that we have made. Fundamental to this is the idea of the "Normal Distribution". The Normal Distribution is the amazing fact that when we talk about large numbers of *anything* in nature the variations in the *thing* we're discussing form a curve that looks like a bell when we plot the measurements of the *things* on a graph (the famous "Bell-Shaped Curve").

Don't worry about this too much (you can look in up on *Wikipedia* if you're interested), but simply understand that almost all variations of a *thing* are small and lie close to the average (actually the *Mean*). How close to the average (Mean) is measured by the *Standard Deviation* and almost all examples of a natural phenomenon fall no more than three Standard Deviations away from the average (Mean). For example: The average/Mean IQ Score is 100 and the IQ Standard Deviation is 15. Thus, most people (68.2%) have an IQ Score between 85 and 115; 95.4% of people have an IQ between 70 and 130; and 99.8% of people have an IQ of between 55 and 145.

As Designers (and GMs) keep this idea in mind. Use Table 2-2: Normal Distributions, below, to help determine what a given value of a rule or die roll target number should be, taking into account how many people should normally be successful in performing the action the rule or die roll is representing. The table shows ranges and you'll see these same figures over and over again throughout the *Übergame* Rules. Remember that the table is describing "Standard Humans" and also that the numbers are rounded off; this is a game after all, not an exact model of real-life. Also remember that for most *Übergame* Settings the Player Characters are supposed to be "a little bit better" than an average, standard Human.

###### Table 2-2: Normal Distributions

|Group Label|Distance<br />From Mean|% Of Population<br />Within This Range|About 1<br />Person in X|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|The Middle Of The<br />Pack/Average| &plusmn;&frac12; Standard<br />Deviation|38.3|3|
|Above/Below<br />Average|&plusmn;1&frac12; Standard<br />Deviations|24.2|4|
|High/Low|&plusmn;2&frac12; Standard<br />Deviations|6.1|17|
|Very High/Low|&plusmn;3&frac12; Standard<br />Deviations|0.6|167|
|Exceptionally<br />High/Low|&plusmn;4&frac12; Standard<br />Deviations|0.02|5,000|
|Incredibly<br />High/Low|&plusmn;5&frac12; Standard<br />Deviations|0.0003|333,333|

- Note that for the figures given in the last two columns on Table 2-2: Normal Distributions are for both the band above the average and below the average ie about 1 person is 17 falls within the High band and about 1 person in 17 falls with the Low Band.
