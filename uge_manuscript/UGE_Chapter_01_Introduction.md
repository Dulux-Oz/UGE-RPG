Welcome to the *Übergame* and the *Übergame Engine* (*ÜGE*): a Role-Playing Game System designed to allow a group of friends to enjoy themselves telling stories and having adventures in any and all types of settings. Within this book and within the companion books that make up the *Übergame* you will find just about everything you need to know to enjoy hours upon hours of fun and adventure with your friends.

Fundamentally *Übergame* is about telling stories! We tell stories as a group and good stories are made up of triumphs and tragedies, dark deeds and heroic actions, vile villeins and noble heroes, and everything in between. Because it is us who are telling these stories it is sometimes tempting for us to have everything go right, but that makes for very boring stories. Far better for things to not always go just as we'd like them too, for those are the times when truly exciting stories are told. Keep this in mind as you read through these rules and play *Übergame* - that it is the stories that we tell that make things the most fun!

If you're an old hand at role-playing games then please, resist the temptation to skip too much of this book; *Übergame* does a few things slightly differently than some other role-playing games which you might be used to. If you've never played a role-playing game before then pay close attention: some of the terms and concepts used in *Übergame* and other role-playing games may seem strange at first, but this book and its companion books have been written to allow you to begin enjoying the game and this hobby as soon and as easily as possible. And if you really get stuck in understanding a term, there's a helpful Glossary at the end of this book.

## What Is An RPG?

A role-playing game (often abbreviated to RPG) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Just about everyone knows about *Computer-Based* or *On-Line Role-Playing Games* these days (such as *World of Warcraft*) where players control a character or avatar through a world different from our own, having adventures, solving puzzles and defeating monsters or aliens. But not many people realise that Computer-Based RPGs were derived from a different sort of Role-Playing experience: what is today called *Tabletop*, *Pen-And-Paper* or *Traditional* Role-Playing.

In a Traditional Role-Playing Game a group of friends sit around a table and, with the aid of some rules, some oddly shaped dice, some pencils and paper and a good deal of imagination, experience the collective story of the adventures of the characters that each player is playing. Each player takes on a role or a persona of the type of hero they most like to be, whether that is a noble knight, a space marine, a grizzled private eye, a pious priest, a crafty cat-burglar, a wizard, a computer or robotics specialist, a mercenary, a fighter pilot... or whatever type of hero they want (that is also appropriate for the story's setting: no space marines in a fantasy story, nor wizards in a science fiction story, either, please - not unless it's a pretty strange story!).

Once everyone has chosen or created an appropriate character, the players then explain to each other what their character is doing in a given situation, perhaps even speaking as their character would speak and relying only on the knowledge that their character would have, never on what they themselves as players would know. One of the players takes on the special role of the Game Master or GM (sometimes also known as the Referee, Dungeon Master, Überlord, Marshal or other, similar names). It's the GM's job to present situations and story outlines to the other players and adjudicate what happens when a character does a certain thing. This is where the rules and the dice come in: the rules so that everyone has a framework as to how the game works and the dice to provide an element of random chance, so that you don't always know if your laser blaster will hit the alien.

Remember that the game is not about the Players versus the GM; the GM is more like a referee than anything else. Yes, the GM plays the monsters and aliens that the players will invariably end up fighting, but the GM always, *always* remains neutral (or at least tries really hard to remain neutral) just like any good referee.

Don't worry about all this too much right now; it will all become clear as you read through this rulebook and play a game session or two.

## Who Is This For?

This book and its companion books has been written with three groups of people in mind. The first group is the *Players*: these are the people who will be enjoying the collective story being told by them and by their GM. Players can be experienced veterans of the RPG hobby or complete newbies or anywhere in between. Every effort has been made to keep things as simple as possible for the Players, so that they can
concentrate on the story being told, but because of its very nature *Übergame* might be a tad complex for a bunch of complete newbies to the role-playing hobby: it's probably best for new Players to try to find a more experienced role-player (not necessarily experienced with *Übergame* ) to help them learn about the RPG hobby.

The second group *Übergame* was written for is the *GMs*. Like Players, GMs have all sorts of levels of experience. Again, we've tried to keep things as simple as possible, but GMs are responsible for the overall story plot for their Players and so GMs need more detail to help them run their games. Eventually, GMs become comfortable enough with running *Übergame* s that they start to create their own settings and rules to do things the way they and their Players want. This is as it should be; *Übergame* can handle this and actually makes it easier to do than some other RPGs.

The final group the *Übergame* and ÜGE were written for is the *Developers*. It's a fine line between a GM and a Developer, and one that we have crossed many times in our time in the RPG Hobby. Because *Übergame* is an *RPG System* it has been designed to allow Developers to add to it and to change it very easily.

So, when you are reading this book and the rest of the *Übergame* books remember that we've got to talk to all three groups and that, sometimes, we're going to be talking about things that aren't particularly relevant to you. We'll try to let you know when we're talking to a particular group, but it never hurts to know and understand more than the bare minimum meant for you.

## On-Line Or Not

With the growing popularity of the Internet and with people more likely to change their home town over their lifetimes, some RPG gaming groups that may in the past have had to break up are finding the use of *Virtual Tabletop* software (or *VTT* software) very useful. With a good VTT they have the ability to play their favourite RPG with friends who have moved across country or even to the other side of the world. A VTT simulates the experience of sitting around the same table and often allows for some of the addition and subtraction that is part of most RPGs to be handled automatically by the computers. This is not playing an On-Line RPG; this is playing a Traditional RPG with the aid of a computer and the Internet.

Arguable the most popular and the best VTT available is *Fantasy Grounds* by SmiteWorks LLC ([www.fantasygrounds.com](www.fantasygrounds.com)). *Übergame* has been designed from the ground up to use *Fantasy Grounds* and the resulting *UGE-RPG Ruleset* for *Fantasy Grounds* is kept fully integrated with the latest version of this popular VTT. You don't have to use *Fantasy Grounds* to play an *Übergame*, but if you do you'll find your gaming enhanced by the ease of play and by the automated features the *UGE-RPG Ruleset* provides to both the Players and the GM. Using *Fantasy Grounds* to play *Übergame* or other RPGs is also a great way to find a gaming group to game with.

## What Style Of RPG Is *Übergame*?

There are many different styles of role-playing games covering many different genres, such as Fantasy, Science Fiction, Wild West, Superhero, Horror, Cyberpunk, Cartoon, Gangster... you name a style of film, novel or TV show and there's almost certainly a Role-Playing Game that covers it.

*Übergame* is all of these and more! That is, using the *Übergame Engine* you can experience any style of game and any setting that you can imagine, or even all of them at the same time. *Übergame* can handle it all: from Stone Age cavemen searching for the secret of fire through Swords and Sorcery Knights and Wizards taking on hordes of Goblins on their way to slay a Dragon to Modern Day Warfare and even high technology Science Fiction, and everything in between.

How can it do this?

Because the *Übergame* RPG System and the *Übergame Engine* at the heart of *Übergame* are modular in nature; designed in a way that allows for various *Rule Modules* to be "plugged in" as required. You can think of it a bit like a popular brick-based construction toy from Denmark: you can take the basic, plastic, multi-coloured brisks and "plug" them one into another to build anything your imagination can conceive. Well, the *Übergame* System and the *Übergame Engine* are like that. For example: If you are playing a Swords and Sorcery game with *Übergame*, such as the *Übergame: Jägerwyrm* setting, then you would use the Magic Module along with various other Modules, but if you were playing a Wild West game then you'd "plug-in" the Firearms Module (and others) instead of the Magic Module.

Don't worry about how all this works for now, we'll cover all of it later. Just be aware that you can choose whichever Rule Modules to use that you want for whatever style of game you want to play and *Übergame* will be able to handle it.

## A Sample Of Play

Below is a sample of play from an *Übergame: Jägerwyrm* Adventure. *Jägerwyrn* is a Swords and Sorcery setting for *Übergame*. By following along you will get a basic idea of how to play *Jägerwyrm* in particular and *Übergame* in general. This sample of play consists of only two characters: Karl, a muscle-bound barbarian from the frozen north and Jenna, a warrior-priestess of the God of the Suns. They have travelled to a remote castle ruin in a hunt for fame, fortune and a magic sword said to have been lost when the castle was sacked some time ago. Karl is played by Mark and Jenna is played by Suzie. Their friend Paul has taken on the task of Game Master.

**GM (Paul):** "You arrive at the castle ruins around midday. After finding somewhere to tie up your horses and after a quick scout around the mostly demolished ruins you discover what appears to be a flight of stairs leading down into the darkness. What would you like to do?"

**Karl (Mark):** "I'll light a torch and heft my battleaxe in my right hand. I'll lead the way down the stairs. Jenna, will you keep an eye on our backs?"

**Jenna (Suzie):** "Yes, OK. I'll ready my shield and my mace and follow Karl down into the darkness."

**GM (Paul):** "The daylight penetrates about 20 feet or so down the stairs, while your torch provides illumination out to about 30 feet. The stairs go down about 25 feet and a corridor leads off north from the foot of the stairs. It's about 10 feet wide and 16 feet high, arched in the centre and made of stone cemented together. The corridor is damp and cool and the torch flickers back and forth in a slight breeze. After about 60 feet you come to a closed door on the left of the corridor, while the corridor itself continues north out of torch-light."

**Jenna (Suzie):** "Do you want to check out the door?"

**Karl (Mark):** "Yes, let's. I take a good look at the door."

**GM (Paul):** "It's a wooden door, probably oak, set into the stone wall. It opens away from you to the left, based on the fact that the door pull is near the right-hand edge. It also appears to be slightly swollen in the damp."

**Karl (Mark):** "I give it a good, hard shove."

At this point Mark rolls a die (or gets *Fantasy Grounds* to do it for him) to see if he can roll over a number specified by Paul as to how hard the door is to open. Because Karl is a big, strong type Mark can add a few extra points to the die roll to represent Karl being so strong.

**Karl (Mark):** "A success! I push open the door and hold the torch high. What do I see?"

**GM (Paul):** "The room beyond the door is about 20 feet by 20 feet and about the same height as the corridor. Against the far wall you can see a large chest with a padlock on the front. However, before you can do anything else you see three bony figures shamble out of the darkness of the room, holding what appear to be rusty swords."

**Karl (Mark):** "I charge forward and engage the closest one."

**Jenna (Suzie):** "By the gods! I wish you'd have waited. I take my Sundisk which is hanging around my neck and hold it out towards the Skeletons. I begin to pray to my god."

Suzie has clutched her Holy Symbol in her hand and is attempting to Turn the Undead Skeletons. She will need to roll a die (or get *Fantasy Grounds* to do it for her) to determine the effectiveness of her attempt. She rolls the die and tells Paul the result.

**GM (Paul):** "A soft, daylight-like light shines out from your Sundisk and washes over the Skeletons. One of them drops its sword and moves back into the room to get away. The other two continue to advance."

**Karl (Mark):** "Alright, I swing my battleaxe at the nearest."

At this point the two intrepid Jägers battle the two remaining Skeletons and, if they win, will have the opportunity to check out the chest for treasure before moving on with the rest of their adventure.

## What Do You Need To Play?

So, what do you need to play an *Übergame*? Well, first of all you'll need some friends. *Übergame* can be played with just two people, but five to seven people is usually the best. This allows for a group of four to six characters (known as a *Party* or a *Company*) and also for someone to be the GM. You can play with bigger parties, but sooner or later the group becomes too big and people will get bored having to wait for everyone else to have their go.

Next, you need the *Übergame* rules: that means primarily this book and perhaps one or two of the other books that make up the *Übergame Engine*, such as a Settings Book (like *Übergame: Jägerwyrm*). The GM will probably need access to all of the relevant books, but some GMs like to "wing it" and run the game from memory.

You'll also need an Adventure: a basic storyline with some sort of goal for the characters to achieve. This can be a commercial adventure purchased from a store or one made up by the GM.

Each Player will need a *Character*, normally recorded on a *Character Sheet*. You can find a copy of a basic blank Character Sheet in Appendix ?? - [Some Name]. Various *Übergame* Setting Books and Rules Modules may require the use of a more specialised character sheet (or additional character sheet pages), but the one in Appendix ?? is usable for most *Übergames*. You can also record the details about your character on a blank piece of paper, but using a character sheet is generally preferred by most people as it keeps things neater and more organised.

You'll need some paper and a pencil, plus probably an eraser and a pencil sharpener. You are much better off using a pencil rather than a pen as you will often need to change various numbers and notes about your character and if you use a pen you can't change things easily.

You'll also need some dice. Most RPGs use dice with a different number of faces, such as four-sided die, twelve-sided die, etc. A "standard" set of RPG Dice can be purchased from most hobby stores or from online: you'll need a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, a 10-sided die, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die - a standard RPG Dice Set comes with all of these and also a second 10-sided die normally marked `10`, `20`, `30`, etc. Appendix A of these rules discusses dice in detail.

Finally, as has been mentioned above, you may like to use the *Fantasy Grounds* VTT with the *UGE-RPG Ruleset* to enhance your game and allow you to game with people from all around the world. You can use the in-built, electronic character sheet in *Fantasy Grounds* and you don't need to have paper, pencil or dice if you do, but you can use physical dice with the *UGE-RPG Ruleset* if you prefer.

## The Dice Code

Just about all RPGs use a common "code" when talking about dice and dice rolls. The code consists of the letter `d` (or `D`, for "dice") followed by a number representing the number of sides of the dice. Thus, a "standard" set of RPG dice has a `d4`, a `d6`, a `d8`, a `d10`, a second `d10` (the one labelled `10`, `20`, etc), a `d12` and a `d20`.

If more than one die of a given type is to be rolled then the code tells us this by a number before the `d`. Thus, `2d6` means roll two 6-sided dice and add the individual die results together for a total of between 2 and 12, while `5d8` means roll five 8-sided dice and add the results together for a total of between 5 and 40.

Sometimes you'll be asked to roll a `d2`, a `d3` or a `d5`. These dice don't normally exist (although it is possible to purchase these unusual sided-dice on-line) but they are very easy to simulate using "standard" dice. To roll a `d2` use a `d6` and treat "evens" as a `2` and "odds" as a `1`. A `d3` is similar: roll a `d6` with a result of `1-2` being a `1`, `3-4` being a `2` and `5-6` being a `3`. This is also the same as taking the result of the `d6` and dividing by 2 and rounding any fractions up. A `d5` can be rolled in the same way: roll a `d10` and divide the result by 2, rounding any fractions up.

Sometimes a number needs to be added to or subtracted from a die roll and this is made clear to us by specifying this number after the number of sides of the die to roll. Thus, `1d6+3` means to roll a 6-sided die and add 3 to the result for a total between 4 and 9, while `3d10-2` means to roll three 10-sided dice and subtract 2 from the result for a total of between 1 and 28.

We sometimes see a die code of `d100` or `d%`. We don't have a 100-sided die but this is where the second `d10` available in the "standard" die set comes in: if we roll two `d10s` we can treat one as the "10s" and the other as the "1s". So in this case if the dice were showing `30` and `5` then our total would be `35`; if the dice were showing `80` and `2` the total would be `82`. If you don't have a specially marked `d10` then you can use any two `d10s` in the same way, provided you have some way of specifying which die is the "10s" and which is the "1s": two different coloured `d10s` is probably the easiest way to do this or two different sizes, but no matter how you do this be consistent: always use the same colour or size for the "10s".

You'll notice that normally a `d10` is numbered `1` to `9` with a `0` instead of a `10` (or `10` to `90` with a `00` instead of `100`). This is simply to make rolling `d100` (`d%`) easier: if the dice are showing `40` and `0` then the total is `40`, while if the dice are showing `00` and `9` the total is `9`. If the dice are showing `00` and `0` then the total is `100`. If rolling a `d10` to produce a number between `1` and `10` then treat the `0` as `10`.

This idea of using multiple `d10s` to produce a `d100` result can be extended to produce a `d1,000` result): simply use a third `d10` for the "100s". This can be taken further to produce a `d10,000` result with four `d10s`; a `d100,000` result with five `d10s`; a `d1,000,000` with six `d10s`; and so on. This `d100` idea is also sometimes used to apply to other sided dice; the most common being `d66` (often written as `dG` or `dg`, after the company whose games made it popular), which means roll two different `d6s` with one representing the "10s" and the other representing the "1s" for totals of `11` thought to `16`, `21` through to `26`, etc.

Finally, here are some other, rarer dice codes that you might come across.

First, some RPGs can ask you to multiply two die rolls together. This is typically written as `d10x` (or, more properly `d10xd10`) which means roll two `d10s` and multiply the two results together. Dice can also be divided as well (`/`) - in fact, it should be becoming obvious by now that dice and Dice Codes can be treated just like regular mathematical equations.

Sometimes we are asked to roll more dice then we need, so we have to discard one or more dice before we add them together. Unfortunately, the RPG Hobby has developed a number of ways to indicate this. The most common ways are to use the codes `k`, `l` and `h` (or `K`, `L` and `H`) for "keep", "lowest" and "highest". A die code of `9d8+k4` means roll `9d8` and keep the highest four die, adding them together; while `7d6-k2` means roll `7d6` and keep the lowest two. Like the "K-Code" variant, `9d8+h4` also means roll `9d8` and keep the highest four die, and `7d6+L2` also means roll `7d6` and keep the lowest two. However, both the "H-Code" and the "L-Code" can also be used with a minus sign (`-`). In these cases the minus sign means "discard the high/low dice". For example: `9d8-L5` means to roll `9d8` and discard the lowest five die (the same as `9d8+k4`), and `7d6-h5` means roll `7d6` and discard the highest five (the same as `7d6-k2`).

Next, there is the idea of "Exploding Dice". This is where if you roll the maximum possible on a given die you get to re-roll that one die and add the second roll to the first. If you roll the maximum again on the second roll you can roll a third die and add it to the first two, and you can keep going, rolling and adding to the total indefinitely, provided you keep rolling the maximum. We use a `!` (sometimes known as a "Bang") to signify Exploding Dice (eg `d6!`).

Exploding dice are often used with Pool Dice. Pool Dice form a Dice Pool, and when you roll Pool Dice instead of adding all the dice together, you treat each die separately. A roll from a Dice Pool is signified by a `p` (or a `P`) at the start of the Dice Code (eg `p5d8` or `p3d6!`)

Finally, almost always when we are rolling dice we are trying to roll over or under some number, known as the *Target Number* (*TN*). In a Dice Code the TN is written as plus or minus `t` (or `T`), so that `1d20+t18` means roll a `d20` and roll equal to or higher than "18", while `2d6-t7` means roll `2d6` and roll equal to or less than "7".

You may occasional come across other Dice Codes when playing RPGs which will be explained when they occur (*Übergame* doesn't use any of these more exotic Dice Codes). Also, realise that all of these Dice Codes can be combined together to produce some really interesting dice rolls (but as a rule of thumb simpler die rolls make for a better game), such as `4d6!+2-L+t15`: roll `4d6+2`, explode (and keep exploding) any dice that rolls a `6`, discard the lowest die and try to equal or beat a target of "15" - phew!

## Final Notes

Throughout this book and in the other books that make up the *Übergame* the male pronoun is used. This is in no way to be taken that females are not welcome to play or that they are inferior in any way; the male pronoun is simply used for convenience and to avoid having to use such phrases as "he/she", "his or hers", etc.

To ensure the smooth running of the game the players must recognise that the GM's word is law and that he has the final say in interpreting the rules of the *Übergame*. With that in mind the *Übergame* Rules should be considered "guidelines" and that the interpretation of these guidelines is up to the GM. This does not mean that the GM will be a dictator; a good GM knows when to listen to his players and how and when to seek compromise, but the players must realise that the GM as referee often has information that the players do not have and so will make rulings and judgement calls to ensure that the game runs smoothly, that the story is not irrecoverably disrupted and, above all else, that everyone has fun, including himself! It is a hard job being the GM; players might like to remember this during the game.

Scattered throughout the *Übergame* books are various comments and observations made by UGE-RPG Project Team (and labelled as such). These "sidebars" are marked with the UGE-RPG icon and contain various tips and tidbits about some aspect of the *Übergame* or about gaming in general.
