> No species is more important than others - Paul Watson

> I don't believe that there are aliens. I believe there are really different people - Orson Scott Card

Like the previous chapter, this chapter is of interest to everybody: Players, GMs and Developers. It ties in closely with the previous chapter and the next chapter as well and all three chapters should be considered together when Designing *Übergame* Settings and Rule Modules.

###### From The UGE-RPG Team

![UGE-RPG Symbol](https://github.com/UGE-RPG/UGE-RPG/blob/master/support_files/übersymbol_medium.png) We use the term "Species" rather than the more common (at least in RPG-terms) "Race" for a couple of reasons: first, because *Übergame* spans all genres and time periods "Species" more accurately conveys this idea; and second, because in contemporary biology "race" as a concept doesn’t really exist - and has even been called "one of science’s greatest mistakes".

## Introduction

One of the things that makes telling stories with Role-Playing Games so much fun is the opportunity to experience the story from the perspective of a different race or species. Most RPGs provide a number of different races or species for players to use for their characters and an even bigger list to use for the monsters/aliens the Player Characters can encounter. The trick with designing different species and monsters/aliens is to keep them "balanced", especially those species designed for use as Player Characters.

## It's All About The Balance

What does this idea of "balance" mean? Does it imply that all of the species in an *Übergame* Setting must be the same or must have the same number of strengths and weaknesses? Well, yes and no.

Yes, if we're talking about species that are designed to be used as Player Characters (hereafter known as Player Species). For these species it is a very good idea to design each species with an equal number of advantages and disadvantages when compared with the Setting's "benchmark species". In most *Übergame* Settings this "benchmark species" is the plain, normal or Standard Human Being, just as it was in the previous chapter. Note that all the Player Species don't necessarily have the same number of advantages and disadvantages as every other Player Race, only that each particular Player Race has an equal number of advantages and disadvantages within itself. This idea will become clearer further on in this chapter.

However, the answer is "No" if we're talking monsters/aliens that the Player Characters will be encountering. It is perfectly acceptable for a monster/alien to be vastly more powerful (or vastly less powerful) than a Player Race because *Übergame* has a system to handle this difference in advantage/disadvantage. We'll discuss this later on.

For now, keep this idea of "balance" in your mind as we discuss all of the details regarding both Player Races and monsters/aliens.

## Describing A Race/Species

So how do we actually go about describing a given species? Well, each individual species is made up of a number of characteristics. These characteristics form a Creature Profile. Part of a creature's Profile is the creature's Primary Abilities and Karma Scores that we discussed in the previous chapter. Other characteristics are listed below. We're going to use the Creature Profile for our "benchmark" Human Being as an example and then describe how to modify the Profile to develop Creature Profiles of other species, including some example Creature Profiles.
