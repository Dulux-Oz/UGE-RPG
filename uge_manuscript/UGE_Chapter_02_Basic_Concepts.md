This chapter will be of interest to everyone, especially people new to *Übergame* and to RPGs in general.

## The Basic Game Mechanic

A character in an *Übergame* can do almost anything that their player can imagine them doing. However, just because you can imagine your character doing something doesn't mean that they are any good at it.

When we need to determine how good (or bad) a character is at doing something we roll one or more dice. We don't need to role for everyday activities (eg walking along a path), but only when the consequences of failing has a dramatic effect on the story being told (eg walking along a narrow ledge over a 200 foot drop).

The type of die being rolled and the number that we have to roll over or under (known as the *Target Number* or *TN*) is determined by the *Übergame* rules. A fairly good percentage of the rules is devoted to explaining which die to roll and in determining the Target Number of the roll. However, in most cases *Übergame* uses the same basic method (or *Rule Mechanic*) for just about all of its rolls. That mechanic is a single 20-sided die roll (`1d20`) with a success indicated by rolling equal to or higher than a given Target Number and a failure indicated by rolling below the Target Number.

The Target Number and the Die Roll are often adjusted by having a Modifier added to or subtracted from them, making a task more difficult or easier than normal.

Almost always (but there are exceptions) a roll of `20` on the die before being adjusted by Modifiers (known as a *Natural 20*) is considered an Automatic Success no matter what the Target Number is and sometimes has the potential for being a *Critical Success*. A Critical Success (also commonly referred to as a *Crit*) is usually very welcome, as it means that the character has been particularly successful in performing whatever task they were doing.

On the other hand, a roll of `1` on the die before being adjusted by Modifiers (a *Natural 1*) is almost always considered an Automatic Failure and also sometimes has the potential of being a *Critical Failure* as well. *Crit Fails* are never welcome, because these mean that not only was the character not successful in the attempted task but was so bad at it that they suffered a catastrophic result because of their bumbling.

So, this game mechanic is the basic one used throughout the bulk of *Übergame*. There are a few variations, but the basic idea explained here remains the same in all but the rarest of die rolls.

## Fail Forward

Traditionally, when a character in an RPG fails a roll the natural way to interpret this is that the character was simply not up to the task. In combat this is the way that things should be interpreted; if the warrior misses his target he has missed his target; if the character was trying to sneak around his foes to stab them in the back and he fails his roll to sneak then he has been detected in his actions.

But outside of combat traditional failure tends to slow the story and the action down rather than move the story along. A more constructive way for the GM to handle things is to treat the failure of a die roll as "something has gone wrong" instead of "the character wasn't good enough to succeed". We call this concept "failing forward".

When we fail forward we treat a failed die roll as a "near success" that also includes some unwanted consequences or side effects. The character probably still fails to achieve the desired goal, but that's because something happens on the way to the goal rather than because nothing happens.

A good example of this idea is found in the movie *Star Wars Episode 6: Return Of The Jedi*. When Han Solo and the others are on the forest moon of Endor Han tries to sneak up on a Storm Trooper but "fails" and treads on stick, snapping it in two and thus alerting the Trooper. Instead of surprising the Trooper and his comrades and knocking them all out quickly, a fight erupts and several Storm Troopers escape on speeder bikes to raise the alarm. Han is ultimately successful in disabling the Trooper, but Luke and Leia are forced to pursue the fleeing Troopers through the forest, leading to a more exciting story.

Another example is when a character fails at a check to gather some information. Instead of getting no information at all, the character could get some misleading information or the target of his information gathering could be alerted to the character's enquires, thus perhaps fleeing his current location or setting up a series of traps and obstacles. The "failure" means that interesting things happen.

## Basic Game Concepts

Now that we understand the basic game mechanic, let's take a look at the basic game concepts inherent to *Übergame*. This won't be a detailed view - we'll get into the full details of each of these concepts in later chapters - but instead this will be a "10,000 foot" overview so that we can understand how everything "fits together". Let's start with the main focus of RPGs: the Characters.

As has been said before and will be said again and again, *Übergame* is a game about telling stories. The protagonists in these stories are the characters, or more accurately the *Player Characters* or *PCs*: those characters being controlled by the players. These are the heroes (and sometimes the villains and anti-heroes) that our stories are about.

A number of aspects go into describing a PC and which give us a framework on which to hang our character's personality, motivations and "playing style". The first of these is the PC's *Abilities*, *Statistics* or *Stats*. These are numbers which represent such things as how strong, smart, agile and good looking the character is (generally referred to as the character's *Primary Abilities*). These form the basis of the character and influence all the other aspects of the character's make-up. These Primary Abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma and Looks and are rated from `-5` (or even lower) to `+5` or higher.

In addition to these Primary Abilities each character has a number of Secondary Abilities. These are Stats that are derived from or influenced by the character's Primary Abilities. Secondary Abilities include the Combat Stats: how good a character is in striking his foes (the To Hit Armour Class Zero or THAC0 Stat); how hard him himself is to strike (Armour Class or AC); how much damage he can sustain (Hit Points or HP); how much damage he can avoid (Damage Reduction or DR); how well the character can resist various effects (the Saving Throws); and how quick he is in combat (the Initiative Bonus). Other Secondary Abilities are the character's Grade, Level and Experience Points (XP); all to do with how experienced or competent the character is.

A character's Armour Class (AC) is an abstract measure of how hard he is to strike in combat. The AC depends upon a number of things including his natural toughness, ability to dodge out of the way and what type of armour he is wearing. For characters AC starts at 10 and goes down, with a lower number being better. AC can even go below zero into the negatives.

Different ACs for Low Impact, High Impact & Energy, or just a bonus vs these types of. Do we also to slashing, piercing and bludgeoning???

The Armour Class Stat has two sub-Stats: Armour Class values for special circumstances. The first of these is the Flat-Footed Armour Class (or FFAC) which measures the AC of the character when he is surprised or somehow not able to dodge out of the way. The second Armour Class sub-Stat is the Touch Armour Class (or TAC) which measures how hard it is to just touch the character, not actually hurt him by getting past any armour he is wearing.

Once a character has been struck in combat they will take damage. Damage is measured in Hit Points (HP), but Hit Points are an abstract measure: Hit Points don't just measure cuts and bruises, broken bones and loss of blood, but also "combat smarts", "resilience" and "toughness". Just because a character has the same number of Hit Points as say, a rhinoceros, doesn't mean that they can take the same amount of physical punishment as a rhinoceros; some of the character's Hit Points actually represent the character's knowledge and experience in knowing how to take the blow so that they actually take less "real damage".

Closely related to a character's AC and to Hit Points is Damage Reduction (DR). Damage Reduction is exactly that: Hit Points of damage that the character can ignore. DR can come from a number of sources, but most DR that a character receives is due to the type of armour he is wearing: some armours "shrug off" damage as well as making a character harder to hit.

When a character want to hit another in combat he uses his THAC0 Stat. THAC0 stands for "To Hit Armour Class Zero" and to use it the character compares his THAC0 to his target's Armour Class. For character's, THAC0 starts at 20 and goes down; the lower the better. Like AC, THAC0 has three sub-Stats: Melee (Hand-To-Hand) THAC0, Ranged THAC0 and Grapple THAC0, each one used in the relevant circumstances.

Sometimes Armour Class or Damage Reduction isn't a good way to represent not taking damage; the armour that a character is wearing doesn't really help when being bathed in fire or avoiding a slip and fall from a high place. In these types of circumstances a character instead makes a Saving Throw. A character's Saving Throw Stats are measured as a Die Modifier (normally a bonus) to a standard Die Roll, with the Target Number determined by the particular circumstances which are causing the roll to be made. There are three Saving Throw Stats: Fortitude, for when the character is trying to resist an effect based on their physical strength and stamina; Reflexes, for when a character is trying to "dodge out of the way" of the effect causing the roll; and Will Power, for when the character is trying to resist the effect based on their will power, personality and sense of self worth.

The final combat stat is the character's Initiative Modifier. The Initiative Modifier is added to the Initiative Die Roll to determine who gets to go first in combat and combat-like situations.

A character's knowledge, learning, competence at their job and experience is measured in Experience Points (XP). As characters move through the world performing acts of heroism and having adventures they learn new things and get better at their jobs - they earn XP. The different professions that characters can follow are divided into Levels, and a certain number of Experience Points is required to be considered to be of a certain level. This is similar to the idea of Trade Apprentices becoming Journeymen who then becoming Master Tradesmen, or Karate White Belts graduating through to Yellow Belts, Green Belts, etc, until they become Black Belt Karate Masters.

Levels are grouped into Grades, with each Grade encompassing five Levels. In most *Übergames* there are five Grades that mortal characters can belong too and thus 25 Levels for characters to progress through. Some *Übergame* Settings have a second set of five Grades (and 25 Levels) used when the characters earn the right to become Immortals (gods and goddesses).

The character's Tertiary Abilities are his Movement Rate (MV); Height and Weight; Hair, Eye and Skin Colour; Gender; Social Standing;
