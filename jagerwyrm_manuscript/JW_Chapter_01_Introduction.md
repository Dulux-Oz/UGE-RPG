# Introduction

Version 0.1

> So... you want to be a Jäger, do you? Want to go out and slay monsters and raid their treasure hordes to get rich quick, hey? Or are you hunting for something nobler, perhaps? Perhaps you seek to right a wrong or protect the weak or defend the defenceless against the hordes of Evil? Or 'tis it glory ye after: glory and fame to end up in the songs of the Bards and be remembered for all time? No matter, no matter; 'tis all the same to me.

> You listen now to Ol' Jack; he'll learn ye the Jägerways. Ol' Jack knows. For thirty Turnings he fought the good fight against the forces of Evil and made a pretty penny as well. Now though, Ol' Jack is too tired to go out any more. Too tired. But he still knows a trick or two.

> So buy an old man an ale and listen close, 'cause their ain't many who know more about Jägerin' than Ol' Jack do\!

Welcome to Jägerwyrm, a high-fantasy Setting for the Übergame Role-Playing Game.

So, let Old Jack and his companions be your guides into the world of Jägerwyrm and into the art of being a Jäger.


## What Style Of RPG Is Jägerwyrm?

There are many different styles of role-playing games covering many different genres, such as Fantasy, Science Fiction, Wild West, Superhero, Horror, Cyberpunk, Cartoon, Gangster... you name a style of film, novel or TV show and there's almost certainly a Role-Playing Game that covers it.

Jägerwyrm is a high-fantasy role-playing game, meaning that you'll be playing or gaming in a world where you can expect to find wizards and magic, noble knights and dashing scoundrels and dragons and other fantastic beasts.

Being a "high-fantasy" role-playing game you can expect magic and the fantastic to be relative common, as opposed to a "low-fantasy" RPG when magic is very scarce and the fantastic like elves and dwarves are almost unheard of. This doesn't mean that in a Jägerwyrm game every villager will own a magic sword or that every hermit is a powerful wizard; just that magic and the fantastic do occur often enough to keep things "interesting".

## What Is a Jäger?

A Jäger is a hunter and the Jägers are the heroes and protagonists in the Jägerwyrm game. In RPGs the players each create a character that become their alter-ego with which they experience the trials and triumphs of the game: in Jägerwyrm the Player Characters are known as Jägers.

In the game world people might become Jägers for all sorts of reasons: some might be hunting simply for the money that adventuring or being a Jäger brings; some might be hunting to right a wrong done to them or to someone else; some might be hunting for secret or obscure knowledge or a rare or one-of-a-kind item; some might be hunting for fame and glory; or it could be any other one or more innumerable reasons.

The most feared and respected creatures in the game world (at least by those still alive to tell the tale) are the dragons or wyrms and it is only the truly heroic or villainous Jägers who hunt them. These are the Jägerwyrms that the game is named after and these are the people who are most admired or despised of all the Jägers by the general population of the game world. Most Jägers dream of someday being ranked amongst the Jägerwyrms, but most do not achieve this lofty goal.

## What Do You Need To Play?


So, what do you need to play a Jägerwyrm game? Well, first of all you'll need some friends. Jägerwyrm can be played with just two people, but five to seven people is the best. This allows for a group of four to six Jägers (known as a Party or a Company) and also for someone to be the JM. You can play with bigger parties, but sooner or later the group becomes too big and people will get bored by having to wait for everyone else to have their go.

Next, you need the Übergame rules: that means primarily this book and perhaps one or two other books that make up the Übergame game. The GM will probably need access to all of the books, but some GMs like to "wing it" and run the game from memory.

You'll also need an adventure. This can be a commercial adventure purchased from a store or one made up by the GM.

You'll need some paper and a pencil, plus probably an eraser and a pencil sharpener. You are much better off using a pencil rather than a pen as you will often need to change various numbers and notes about your Jäger and if you use a pen you can't change things easily.

You'll also need some dice. Most RPGs use dice with different number of faces, such as four-sided die, twelve-sided die, etc. A "standard" set of RPG Dice can be purchased from most hobby stores or from online: you''ll need a 4-sided die, a 6-sided die, an 8-sided die, a 10- sided die, a 12-sided die and a 20-sided die - a standard RPG Dice Set come with these and also a second 10-sided die normally marked 10, 20, 30, etc. Appendix A of these rules discusses dice in detail.

Finally, as has been mentioned above, you may like to use the Fantasy Grounds VTT with the UGE-RPG Ruleset to enhance you game and allow you to game with people from all around the world. You don't need to have paper, pencil or dice if you use Fantasy Grounds, but you can use physical dice with the UGE-RPG Ruleset if you prefer.

## Final Notes

Throughout this document and in the accompanying documents that make up the Jägerwyrm game the male pronoun is used. This is in no way to be taken that females are not welcome to play or that they are inferior in any way; the male pronoun is simply used for convenience and to avoid having to use such phrases as he/she, his or hers, etc.
