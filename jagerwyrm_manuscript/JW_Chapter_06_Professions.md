# Professions

Version 0.1

## Introduction

Every Jäger is different and every Jäger approaches the art of being a Jäger (the Jägerart) in a different way. However, each skill and special ability that a Jäger brings to the Jägerart can be broadly grouped into a number of different Professions or Classes. This chapter deals with all of the details about those Classes: their strengths, their weaknesses, the individual skills and special abilities that go into making up a given Class, which races are
permitted or forbidden from following a Class, how a Jäger gets better over time in their chosen Class (or Classes) and everything else that a Jäger needs to know about Classes.

## Class Groups

Classes themselves fall into four broad categories or Class Groups. Each Class Group approaches the Jägerart with a different focus and a different emphasis on skills and special abilities. Each of the Class Groups is outlined below.

### The Warrior Class Group

The Warrior group of Classes approaches the Jägerart from a combat-orientated point of view. Jägers from this Class Group are very good with weapons of all sorts, are experts at combat and tend to favour being strong and healthy over all other aspects. The Warrior Classes tend to be easier to play then Classes from the other Class Groups; after all, how difficult is it to hit someone over the head.

Not all Warriors are big and dumb, however. Within the Warrior Class Group exist ever type of warrior you can imagine: from hulking barbarians to highly skilled military officers; from simple soldiers to highly trained specialists in wilderness combat; from expert longbowmen to skilled swordsmen; and from bounty hunters to religious and judicial champions.

The Warrior Class Group has the following Classes as its members:

- Barbarians
- Blackguards
- Bushi
- Fighters
- Kensai
- Knights
- Monks
- Paladins
- Rangers
- Samurai
- Sohie

### The Scoundrel Class Group

The Scoundrel Class Group approaches the Jägerart from the point of view that there are other ways to succeed than just bashing at things with a sword. They are concerned with deception, misdirection, charm and using their large number of skills to achieve their goals, as opposed to brute force and combat-expertise. Don't be mislead, however: Scoundrels can handle themselves in a fight; they just prefer to use their non-combat abilities to avoid the fight in the first place; after-all, combat can get you killed! Scoundrels tend to favour agility and social finesse over all other aspects, and are the second most easiest group of Classes to play, primarily because they have the most options available to them.

Within the Group there are number of different ways of following the Group's basic path: some Scoundrels focus heavily on skills, perfecting as many different types of skills as they can; some Scoundrels prefer to use their charm and natural performance ability to actually wield a form of melodic magic with their music known as *Recitals*; and some prefer to become masters of the hidden strike, defeating their enemies before their enemies even know that they are there.

The Scoundrel Class Group has the following Classes as its members:

- Assassins
- Bards
- Ninja
- Rouges
- Yazuza

### The Priest Class Group

The Priest Class Group approaches the Jägerart with the divine blessings of the gods. Everything Priests do they do to enhance their god's reputation and to spread their god's teachings and influence. Second only to the Warrior Class Group in terms of combat-expertise, Priests are not like the clergy of today's modern world, but are the crusading, armour-wearing, weapon-wielding defenders of the faith from ages past. Priests primarily tend to favour willpower, wisdom and insight over all other aspects.

Touched with the divine power of their patron god or spirit, or by the very power of nature itself, Priests not only swing a mean mace but also have access to a form of divine magic known as *Miracles*; able, through the divine influence of their god, to heal, cure disease, create food and drink and all manner of other miraculous events - or even the dark opposites of these if of an Evil nature. Some Priest also have other divine abilities, such as the ability to change form into that of an animal or the ability to influence the Undead.

Priests are moderately difficult to play, primarily because of the extra divine abilities and their access to divine magic.

The Priest Class Group has the following Classes as its members:

- Clerics
- Druids
- Shugenja

### The Mage Class Group

The Mage Class Group approaches the Jägerart with a focus almost entirely on Magic and learning. Mages are the scientists of Jägerwyrm, able to eventual wield vast magical power but with only limited combat-expertise. Mages favour raw brain power and learning above all other aspects.

There are many paths within the Mage Class-Group. Some Mages prefer to know a little bit about all forms of arcane magic, while others prefer to specialise in a single form of arcane magic while retaining a more limited selecting of arcane spells, known as *Hexes*, from areas outside their specialisation.

Related to Mages are Mind Walkers; Jägers able to preform magic-like feats with only the power of their minds. These Mind Powers may be a form of magic not yet understood or they may be something quite different entirely. Either way, Mind Walkers are part of the Mage Class-Group because their outlook on the Jägerart is the same as those of Mages.

The Mage Class Group has the following Classes as its members:

- Mind Walkers
- Wizards
- Wu Jen

## Primary Class And Multi-Classing

Every Jäger has a Primary Class, which is the main focus of the Jäger's career. Some Jägers may have one or two Secondary Classes, which are auxiliary areas that a Jäger may choose to add to their primary area of expertise. When a Jäger has one or two Secondary Classes they are known as being Multi-Classed, while a Jäger with only a Primary Class is known as being Single-Classed.

Most of the rules in the Jägerwyrm game are written for the Primary Class of Single-Classed Jägers, and if a rule or concept does not specify otherwise then it is to be read and applied in the framework of the Jäger's Primary Class. When special modifications to the rules are required for a Jäger's Secondary Class or Classes the rules will explicitly state this.

The choice to be single- or multi-classed is chosen during Jäger Creation and cannot be changed at a later date. Multi-classed Jägers have many more skills and abilities when compared to single-classed Jägers, but single-classed Jägers gain access to more powerful abilities sooner then multi-classed Jägers do; its the classic case of "jack-of-all-trades" versus "mastery of a few".

## Levels

A fundamental concept in Jägerwyrm is one of Levels. Levels are a measure of just how powerful something is. Spells of all types are grouped into Levels, as are the monsters and creatures Jägers hunt. Every Class is also divided into Levels and most of a Class's abilities and benefits are determined by which Level a Jäger has achieved in the particular Class.

Jägers generally start at 1<sup>st</sup> Level within their chosen Class or Classes and progress through to Level 25, if they survive that long.

Non-Jägers generally do not have a Level nor a Class and so are known as being Level 0 or 0<sup>th</sup> Level.

## Apprentice Jägers

It is possible to become a Jäger before being fully trained in a chosen Class or Classes: before reaching Level 1. These Jägers are not Level 0 but are instead known as Apprentices and have a Level of A.

Apprentice Jägers come about in one of two ways. First, some story-lines require some or all of the Jägers to begin the story not quite fully trained. If the GM decides that the story he and the Players will be telling is this type of story then this is something that will be outlined to the Players before the game begins.

Secondly, as explained in Chapter X - Anthropology each Jäger has a Social Class and Jägers must be a certain Social Class or higher to be accepted for training into a given Class. For those Jägers who do not have the required minimum Social Class, however, all is not lost: the Jäger begin as a lowly Level A Apprentice instead.

It should also be noted that there are three Classes which have two Apprentice Levels: Level A and Level A2. Level A2 can be thought of as "Junior Apprentices". Full details of these Junior Apprentice Levels are given in the individual Class Descriptions, later on in this chapter.

## Grade

Class Levels are grouped into Grades, sometimes known as Level Grades. Each Grade contains five Levels (apart from the first) and there are five Grades that mortal Jägers can progress through. There are also five Immortal Grades which will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter X - Theology.

Grades are important because while gaining Levels within a Grade is relatively straight forward, changing Grades has extra, additional requirements. Changing Grade also has greater rewards that just changing Level.

Table 6-1: Mortal Grades, below, lists the five mortal Grades and the corresponding Class Levels, requirements and benefits.

###### Table 6-1: Mortal Grades

|Grade|Levels|Requirements|Benefits|
|:--|:-:|:--|:--|
|Jäger|A-5| |Special Ability Slot (if Human)|
|Expert|6-10| |Special Ability Slot (if Human)|
|Champion|11-15| |Special Ability Slot (if Human)|
|Master|16-20| |Special Ability Slot (if Human)|
|Grand Master|21-25| |Grand Master Special Ability Slot (if Human)|

## Negative Levels

It is possible, through a variety of means, to temporarily or even permanently be reduced in Level. This reduction is known as gaining a Negative Level.

For each Negative Level a Jäger has the Jäger suffers a `-1` to all Skill Checks, Ability Checks, Attack Rolls and Saving Throws.

For each Negative Level the Jäger's Primary Class's level is effectively reduced by 1. As a Jäger's Secondary Class or Classes (if any) cannot be a higher level than their Primary Class, the Jäger's Secondary Class or Classes may also effectively be reduced by 1.

If any Class effectively reduced is one that allows the Jäger to Activate Spells, he loses access to one Spell of that Class as if he had Activated his highest currently available level of Spell for that Class. If the Jäger has more than one Spell at his highest level for that Class available, he can chose which he loses. In addition, when he next prepares Spells or regains Spell Slots, he gets one less Spell Slot at his highest Spell Level in that Class.

Finally, a Jäger with a number of Negative Levels at least equal to his Primary Class Level is instantly slain. Depending on the creature that killed him, he may rise the next night as a monster of that kind. Otherwise, he will rise as a Wright.

Negative Levels from Level Drain (a type of attack) remain for 24 hours or until removed with a Spell, such as *Restoration*. After 24 hours, the afflicted creature must attempt a Fortitude Save. The Target Number of this Save is **10 + &frac12; the attacker's Hit Dice (HD) + the attacker's CHR**. If the Saving Throw is successful the Negative Level goes away with ho harm done to the Jäger and all penalties and harmful effects are removed. If the Saving Throw is failed the Negative Level goes away, but the Jäger's Level in their Primary Class is permanently reduced by 1. Secondary Classes are also
permanently reduced if necessary to ensure that a Jäger's Secondary Class Level does not exceed his Primary Class Level. Each Negative Level applied to the Jäger's Primary Class must be saved for separately.

When a level is permanently reduced the Jäger loses any Skill Points for that level (including bonus points for having a high INT score). These Skill Points are taken from the highest ranking skills the Jäger has and are applied one Skill Point at a time. The Jäger's Maximum Class Skill Rank and Maximum Non-Class Skill Rank Limits are also reduced by 1 and &frac12;, respectively and he loses any Special Abilities gained from the level lost. He also loses all Class Benefits for the lost level, including THAC0 increases, extra Attacks, Saving Throw Bonuses and Class Features.

Magecasters lose any extra Spells, the ability to Activate extra Spells and/or the ability to Activate Spells at a higher level.

Finally, for each level lost, the Jäger must roll the Class's Hit Dice to determine how many Hit Points are permanently lost, including any extra Hit Points due to having a high CON score. Yes, it is possible to lose more Hit Points form a lost level than were originally gained. Multi-class Jägers do get to divide the result of this die roll by the same amount that they would normally for having more than one Class.

When a Jäger permanently loses a level his XP Total is reduced so that he has enough XP to place him at the half-way mark of his new, lower level.

## Maximum Level

Certain races are naturally more suited to some Classes over others, due to cultural, physiological and/or psychological factors. This can be so extreme that some races cannot follow some Classes at all. In other cases this means that a given race needs to spend additional Experience Points to gain levels in those less-suitable Classes. This is represented by the Maximum Level statistic shown on Table 6-2: Elf Class Level Maximums, Table 6-3: Gervian Human Class Level Maximums, Table 6-4: Gervian Racial Class Level Maximums and Table 6-5: Orantal Racial Class Level Maximums, below. 

Once a Jäger has reached the given Maximum Level it cost twice as many Experience Points as shown on the Class Tables to continue to increase that Class's Level, up to twice the Maximum Level shown. Between twice the Maximum Level and three times the Maximum Level it cost three times the Experience Points shown; four times the Experience Points for between three and four times the Maximum Level shown and so on. The XP Cap for the given Class Level is likewise multiplied by the same amount.

The Maximum Level, in all cases, is modified by any Prime Requisite Ability Score the Class may have, but may never be greater than 25.

## Multi-Class Combinations

**Assassin/Cleric:** This combination gives great potential in defensive and stealth situations and very powerful assassination attack capabilities. Hit Points are good because of Clerical hit dice. Dark Elves, Half-Elves and Half-Orcs may be Assassin/Clerics.

**Assassin/Cleric/Fighter:** This combination gives excellent missile and melee combat ability, plus great potential in defensive and stealth situations and also assassination attack capabilities. Hit Points are good. Dark Elves and Half-Orcs may be Assassin/Cleric/Fighters.

**Assassin/Fighter:** This combination gives excellent missile and melee combat ability, plus assassination and stealth potential. Hit points are good. Dark Elves, Wild Elves, Half-Elves and Half-Orcs may be Assassin/Fighters.

**Barbarian/Cleric:** This combination is strong in defensive and revitalisation capabilities, plus has the great offensive melee combat power of the Barbarian. Hit points average will be very good. Half-Orcs may be Barbarian/Clerics.

**Barbarian/Rogue:** By combining these two classes - the armour, weapons, and combat capabilities of the Barbarian with the stealth and other abilities of the Rogue - a very effective Jäger is created. Hit points are very good. Half-Orcs may be Barbarian/Rogues.

**Bushi/Wu Jen:** This combination allows excellent defensive protection, the use of weaponry and Hexes. Hit points are good on the average. Hengeyokai and Korobokuru may be Bushi/Wu Jen.

**Bushi/Yakuza:** By combining these two classes - the armour, weapons, and combat capabilities of the Bushi with the stealth and other abilities of the Yakuza - a very effective Jäger is created, even though Yakuza abilities restrict the Jäger to leather armour and no shield. Hit points are good. Korobokuru may be Bushi/Yakuza.

**Bard/Cleric:** This is a combination which gives both defensive and musical potential. Hit points are improved with regard to the Bard Class only. As with all Bard Class combinations, however, any functions as a Bard are under the restrictions of that Class with regard to armour. Dwarves and Half-Elves may be Bard/Clerics.

**Bard/Fighter:** Bard/Fighters combine the armour, weapons and combat capabilities of the Fighter with the stealth and other abilities of the Bard. Of course, the Bard abilities restrict the Jäger to light armour. Hit Points are good. Dwarves and Half-Elves may be Bard/Fighters.

**Bard/Ranger:** Similar to a Bard/Fighter, this combination is potent in outdoor situations as well. Half-Elves may be Bard/Rangers.

**Cleric/Fighter:** This combination is strong in defensive and revitalisation capabilities, plus the offensive missile and melee combat power of the Fighter. Hit points average will be good, but not quite as good as the Barbarian/Cleric. Dwarves, Amazonian Elves, Dark Elves, High Elves, Gnomes, Halflings, Half-Elves and Half-Orcs may be Cleric/Fighters.

**Cleric/Fighter/Wizard:** One of the best of the Multiclass options, this gives good offensive and defensive Spell capability plus the Fighter's melee combat strength. Dark Elves, High Elves and Half-Elves may be Cleric/Fighter/Wizards.

**Cleric/Ranger:** Similar to a Cleric/Fighter, this combination is potent in outdoor situations as well. Amazonian Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves and Half-Elves may be Cleric/Rangers.

**Cleric/Ranger/Wizard:** Similar to a Cleric/Fighter/Wizard, this combination is potent in outdoor situations as well. Amazonian Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves and Half-Elves may be Cleric/Ranger/Wizards.

**Cleric/Rogue:** This is a combination which gives both defensive and stealth potential. Hit points are improved with regard to the Rogue Class only. As with all Rogue Class combinations, however, any functions as a Rogue are under the restrictions of that Class with regard to armour, i.e. only leather armour and no shield. Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Halflings, Half-Elves and Half-Orcs may be Cleric/Rogues.

**Cleric/Wizard:** This combination gives the Jäger a great variety and selection of Spells, as well as the use of more weapons. Hit points are somewhat better than those of a Wizard alone. Elves and Half-Elves may be Cleric/Wizards.

**Druid/Fighter:** Similar to a Cleric/Fighter, this combination has a more wilderness focus. Amazonian Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves and Half-Elves may be Druid/Fighters.

**Druid/Ranger:** This combination presents the ultimate in controlled wilderness adventuring, without the unfocussed ferocity of the Barbarian. Amazonian Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves and Half-Elves may be Druid/Fighters.

**Druid/Ranger/Wizard:** Similar to the Cleric/Ranger/Wizard this combination is even more wilderness focussed. Amazonian Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves and Half-Elves may be Druid/Ranger/Wizards.

**Druid/Rogue:** Similar to a Cleric/Rogue, this combination has a more wilderness focus. Amazonian Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves and Half-Elves may be Druid/Rogues.

**Druid/Wizard:** Similar to a Cleric/Wizard, this combination also has a more wilderness focus. Amazonian Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves and Half-Elves may be Druid/Wizards.

**Fighter/Rogue:** Similar to their Orantal counterparts the Bushi/Yakuza, Fighter/Rogues combine the armour, weapons and combat capabilities of the Fighter with the stealth and other abilities of the Rogue. Of course, the Rogue abilities restrict the Jäger to leather armour and no shield. Hit Points are good. Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Halflings, Half-Elves and Half-Orcs may be Fighter/Rogues.

**Fighter/Rogue/Wizard:** Combat, Hex and stealth capabilities are given to the Jäger who opts for this Multiclass combination. This is a very powerful mix. Hit Points are good on the average. Elves and Half-Elves may be Fighter/Rogue/Wizards.

**Fighter/Wizard:** Obviously, this combination allows for expanded use of weaponry and Hexes, similar to their Orantal counterparts the Bushi/Wu Jen. Hit Points are good on the average. Elves, Gnomes (as Wizard: Illusionists only) and Half-Elves may be Fighter/Wizards.

**Ranger/Rogue:** Just like their Fighter/Rogue brethren, Ranger/Rogues add stealth capabilities to the outdoor or city aspects of the Ranger. Of course, the Rogue abilities restrict the Jäger to leather armour and no shield. Hit Points are good. Half-Elves Ranger/Rogues.

**Ranger/Wizard:** Similar to a Fighter/Wizard, this combination is potent in outdoor situations as well. Amazonian Elves, High Elves, Wood Elves and Half-Elves may be Ranger/Wizards.

**Rogue/Wizard:** This combination does not offer all of the options open to a Fighter/Rogue/Wizard, but advancement is usually more rapid. Average Hit Points are fair. Elves, Gnomes (as Wizard: Illusionists only) and Half-Elves may be Rogue/Wizards.

**Wu Jen/Yakuza:** Similar to their Gervian counterparts, the Rogue/Wizard, Wu Jen/Yakuza have good Hex and stealth capabilities, although Hit Points are only fair on the average. Korobokuru may be Wu Jen/Yakuza.

## Experience

Jägers are a cut about the rest of society. They follow unusual (or at least rare) Professions and perform amazing deeds worthy of being immortalised in song and story.

However, not all Jägers who follow a certain Class are the same in terms of ability; some are only novices, just starting out on their adventuring career, while others are wise and knowledgeable in the Jägerart and in performing acts of daring-do.

After a Jäger has bravely set out and survived an adventure he will have learned something. Sometimes this is a positive learning experience (the nearby Goblin tribe is quite weak and therefore quite friendly towards people travelling through their territory), while sometimes it is a negative learning experience (don't centre your *Fireball* Hex too close, otherwise you'll be caught in the area of effect). Either way, the Jäger has learned something. This learning is expressed in Experience Points or XP.

XPs can be thought of as "learning potential". As we live life and grow older we have the ability to learn new things; however, this is only a potential - we have to apply ourselves to learn the new skill or ability. Some never take up the opportunity, while some "spend" their potential in learning how to increase their professional or social standing by learning their organisation's politics and move into the "movers and shakers" circle of their peers. Others spend this potential in applying themselves so that others think less badly of them, thus helping to improve their Honour, while still others use up this potential in controlling vast energies (ie Magic) and so have less to spend on actually learning new skills and abilities. However, most spend this potential to actually learn real abilities and skills or improve existing ones.

### Earning Experience Points

At the end of an adventure or whenever else he deems appropriate, the GM will award XP to the Jägers for performing well during the adventure.

This is usually a group award, awarded to the group for successfully defeating (not necessarily killing) monsters, solving puzzles, disarming or avoiding traps, furthering the story plot, gaining treasure and other such activities. The GM may also award XP to an individual Jäger for doing something extraordinary, such as coming up with a brilliant plan, single-handedly defeating a monster, having the Jäger's Player play the flaws, alignment and other idiosyncrasies of his Jäger properly, making sure that everyone has fun, abiding by the GM's decisions once a decision has been made and similar actions that help promote the game. The GM may also deduct XP from a Jäger for a variety of reasons, usually as a sign that the Player is not playing the Jäger consistently with the Jäger' background, personality or goals or disturbing the other Players' enjoyment of the game.

Individual Jägers may also earn an Experience Point Bonus for a given Class if they have a high enough Ability Score in the Class's Prime Requisite. These Prime Requisite Abilities are listed with the individual Class Descriptions later in this chapter and the Score must generally be `+3` or more.

All XP when earned is allocated immediately to one or more of the uses outlined below - there is no such thing as an "XP Bank".

### The XP Cap

It takes time to assimilate new skills and abilities and the Human and Demihiman brain can only absorb so much new information at once before it needs to process and classify that information to allow it to be used. This is simulated by the XP Cap.

The XP Cap is the maximum amount of XP a Jäger can accumulate and is the total of all of his Class's XP Caps. Once a Jäger has reached the XP Cap any excess XP are simply lost - the Jäger is not able to process any extra learning experiences until he takes time to process those already learnt ie the Jäger must increase in level (or reduce his XP Total in some other way). Once the Jäger increases in level the XP Cap is recalculated and the Jäger can resume earning XP.

When earning XP the XP Cap is always applied first, before the Jäger has the opportunity to "spend" or allocate XP on any of the possible uses outlined below.

### The Use OF Experience Points

Experience Points can be used for several things. Probably the most important use of XP is in the gaining of Class Levels. When an Jäger has earned sufficient XP he may increase his level: the exact details are outlined below.

XP can also be used to raise a Jäger's Honour into the Honourable range. This represents the Jäger forgoing the chance to actually learn new things and instead put their time and energy into improving other people's opinion of them (a factor in determining an individual's Honour). This is more fully detailed in Chapter X - Honour, Fame And Oaths.

Another use of XP is in the Activation of certain high level Spells. Certain Spells (eg *Wish*) require the Activator to expend XP to cause the effect to occur. This is more fully detailed in the Jägergrimoire (the Jägerwyrm Book of Spells).

Other uses of XP are outlined elsewhere throughout the rules.

As a general rule-of-thumb, it is best to allocate XP to increasing level first, before allocating it for other uses.

#### Increasing Level

The primary use of XP is in increasing Level and in changing Grade.

To increase a Level the Jäger simply has to allocate enough XP to this task and obtain the GM's permission to increase his Level. Also required is a certain amount of training time as determined by the GM; usually one Tenday.

Each Class requires a different amount of XP for each level and once a Jäger has allocated enough XP he is then eligible for the appropriate level.

When a Jäger increases his level and/or changes his Grade he obtains certain additional benefits over and above what he had previously earned. These benefits, along with the XP range applicable for each level, are detailed on the various Class Tables provided later on ion this chapter.

When a Multi-class Jäger allocates XP to increase his levels he must allocate XP to all of his Classes evenly. The Jäger may not allocate different amounts to different Classes unless explicitly stated in the individual Class Descriptions). Thus, if one or more of the Jäger's Classes is already at maximum the part of the XP allocated to increasing level that would be applied to this Class is simply lost.

In addition to the above, a Jäger's Secondary Class or Classes can never have a level higher than the Jäger's Primary Class.

#### Changing Grade

Changing Grade involves gaining a level and also fulfilling the additional requirements outlined on Table 6-1: Mortal Grades, above. As is shown, there is an XP cost to change Grade. This XP cost does not have to be paid/allocated in a lump sum if the Jäger doesn't want to; instead, the Jäger can "pay off" the XP cost to change his current Grade over the time he spends within the Grade. However, it is not possible to "pay off" the XP cost of the next Grade change until the Jäger is a member of that Grade.

This then provides the Jäger with a choice: do they slowly and steadily pay off the XP cost in instalments, thus potentially slowing down their rate of level gain within their Grade and thus potentially running into the XP Cap more often, or do they pay the XP Cost in a few big amounts once they achieve the maximum level for their Grade, meaning that they progress as far as possible as fast as possible, potentially avoiding any XP Cap entanglements but sitting stuck at the maximum level for their Grade for quite a while.

#### Reallocating (Spending) Experience Points

It is possible to reallocate XP from those already allocated to gaining levels (and only for gaining levels), but the following rules apply.

First of all, any XP reallocated must not cause the Jäger to go down in level. This obviously puts a cap on the amount of XP available to be reallocated. This also applies in using XP for the Activation of Spells (where applicable).

Multi-class Jägers must reallocate XP evenly from each of their Classes. It is not permissible to take all or most of the XP from only one Class unless explicitly stated otherwise. If a given Class has special rules about the allocation of XP to it, then reallocating XP from that Class must follow the same rules (or at least, the spirit of the rules). This obviously puts a further limit on the amount of XP available for reallocation.

## Duel-Classing

Unlike Multiclassed Jägers who are of Demihuman races, the Jäger with two Classes must be Human. To attain the second Class, the Jäger must switch his profession at some point. Thereafter no progression in the original Class is possible. The decision to Dual-Class can be made at any time.

In order to switch from one Class to another, the Jäger must have at least `+3` in their current Class's Prime Requisite and Minimum Ability Scores (if the current Class has a Prime Requisite and/or Minimum Ability Scores) and at least `+3` in the Prime Requisite and Minimum Ability Scores of the Class 
the Jäger is changing too (if the changed too Class has a Prime Requisite and/or Minimum Ability Scores). If the changed too Class has Minimum Ability Scores greater than 16 the Minimum Ability Scores must be met. The Jäger must also be at least 2<sup>nd</sup> level in their first Class before changing 
Classes. Note that nearly any combination of Classes is thus possible. Alignment will preclude some combinations.

When the Jäger opts to cease his old profession and become a new Class, the Jäger retains the number of Hit Dice (and the commensurate Hit Points) due to an Jäger of the level of his old Class. However, all other functions of the Jäger are at 1<sup>st</sup> level, for that is his ability in the newly espoused Class. Furthermore, if, during the participation of any adventure the Jäger resorts to the use of any of the capabilities or functions of his previous Class the Jäger gains no experience for the adventure. Having switched Classes, the Jäger must perform strictly within the parameters of his new profession. Reversion to the former Class negates all experience potential for the new Class with respect to the course of recent activities, i.e. the adventure during which the original profession's functions were resorted to.

At such time as the Jäger has attained a level of experience in his new Class which exceeds the Jäger's former Class Level, the Jäger may mix functions freely and still gain experience, although restrictions regarding armour, shield and/or weapons apply with regard to operations particular to one or both Classes.

Note that it is not possible to follow a third Class via this method.
