## Introduction

The lands of Cartivus (the world of Jägerwyrm) are made up of four huge continents and numerous large and small islands. The two main continents are Gervia (where most of the Jägerwyrm Adventures take place) and Orant. Orant lies to the east of Gervia and the two are separated by the Dry Steppes, a vast series of arid plains and lowlands inhabited only by monsters and the occasional band of nomads.

To the south of Gervia and separated by the forbidding Straights of Gloom lies Swalu, a land of jungles and mountains extending deep into the Southern Ocean. Few travel to Swalu and apart from the northern coastline the land is unexplored and (presumably) uninhabited by any except savages.

To the west of Gervia is the Endless Ocean, while to the east of Orant is the Asa No Taiyo No Umi (Ocean of the Morning Suns). Between these two immense bodies of water lies Cartivus' last continent: Atzuma. Atzuma is so far removed from both Gervia and Orant that most believe it is only a legend, and few if any have stepped upon its shores.

These then are the lands from which Jägers are drawn. The vast majority of Jägers will come from either Gervia or Orant, depending upon what type of game the GM is running and Jägers from either continent do occasional appear in adventures taking place on the other. Very, very rarely one of the savages from Swalu may appear in Gervia or even Orant, but normally this is not the case. To date there have been no Jägers from Atzuma.

Very few species live in both Gervia and Orant (and elsewhere), with the Human race as the only race eligible as a Jäger to do so. Even so, the Gervian Humans and Orantal Humans are as different as Orantal Wyrms are to the Gervian Wyrms.

## Racial Balance

Some races are inherently more powerful than others. To provide some balance, those Jägers from races that are more powerful start their careers with one or more Flaws taken from Chapter XX - Traits And Flaws. The number of Flaws a given race has (if any) is listed with the race's Features.

## The Races Of Gervia

These are the races found on the continent of Gervia who are appropriate for play as a Jäger.

### Dwarf

physical appearance

Clothing &amp; equipment &amp; armies

architecture/living spaces

attitudes

society

real-world culture

names

The closest real-world culture to the Übergame's Dwarves are the Celts, primarily the realworld Scottish and most of the real-world Celtic (Scottish) culture applies, except where outlined here.

Dwarf names are made up of a personal name followed by a patronymic beginning with "Mac", which in the Dwarven language means "Child of" or "Belonging to" (e.g. Marrok MacHoff: Marrok, child of Hoff). Often a Dwarf will include their Clan Name as well (Marrok MacHoff MacCardon: Marrok, child of Hoff, belonging to the clan of Cardon). When a Dwarf is a descendant of a particularly famous Dwarf, he may incorporate his famous ancestor's name into his own as well (Marrok MacHoff MacMarrok: Marrok, child of Hoff, descendant of Marrok). This can go on for generations of names and very important Dwarves may take an hour or more to introduce themselves in a formal setting.

Sometimes a Dwarf will pick up a pseudonym or nickname, usually something to do with metal or stone (such as Ironfist or Rockbelly). These pseudonyms are sometimes used in place of the patronymic (Marrok Ironfist instead of Marrok MacHoff). Sometimes Dwarves use these pseudonyms as a second name, incorporating it into their proper names (Marrok Ironfist MacHoff), leading to descendants of the Dwarf using the pseudonym instead of the proper name as their patronymic (Prellis MacIronfist). This is frowned upon by Dwarven "high society", but the practice is reasonably common.

#### General Dwarf Racial Features

All Dwarf Jägers have the following Racial Features in addition to any Racial Features they may get for their individual sub-race:

- Constitution +1
- Charisma -1
- Looks -1
- Medium Sized
- Base speed of 20'
- Poison Saves +2
- Magic Saves +2
- Appraise Checks +2 for mineral items
- Disable Device Checks +3
- Craft Check +2 for metals
- Talent: Infravision
- Talent: Racial Enemy: Greenskins
- Talent: Giant Dodge
- Talent: Stonecunning
- Climb Checks -2
- Open Lock Checks -1

The Dwarvish race split into three a long time ago, during and after the Kin Strife Wars and the Sundering. Although only two of the three sub-races are appropriate for use as a Jäger, each of the three sub-races is outlined below.

#### Cave Dwarf

Cave Dwarves are not a suitable race for Jägers.

#### Hill Dwarf

Hill Dwarves are the most common type of Dwarf. Favouring hills and the near surface of mountains, Hill Dwarves once existed as a great empire along the Drashgrab Mountains. Now, most of the kingdoms are little more than isolated villages.

Most Hill Dwarves now live in either Human cities and towns or clustered around small mines. Only Karah-Kuznuckle, known as Gem Mountain in the Merchants' Tongue, remains as a thriving Hill Dwarf kingdom. Sadly, the race of Hill Dwarves is a race in decline.

##### Hill Dwarf Racial Features

Hill Dwarf Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Dwarf Racial Features listed above:

- Languages: Competent Dwarf: Hill, Intermediate Merchants' Tongue

#### Mountain Dwarf

Mountain Dwarves are very much like their Hill Dwarf cousins, although they favour the high mountains and the deep places beneath them more then the hills. Apart from being slightly taller, heavier and lighter in skin tone, there is not much difference between the two races.

Mountain Dwarves once had kingdoms all along the Worldspine Mountains, until Orcs and Goblins drove them away during the Orc Wars. Now, there are no Mountain Dwarf kingdoms left. Instead, Mountain Dwarfs live and work side by side with their Hill Dwarf cousins, living in Human cities, around mines and also making up a large percentage of the population of Karah-Kuznuckle. If the Hill Dwarves are a race in decline, the culture of the Mountain Dwarves is all but gone.

##### Mountain Dwarf Racial Features

Mountain Dwarf Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Dwarf Racial Features listed above:

- Languages: Competent Dwarf: Mountain, Intermediate Merchants' Tongue

### Elf

Elf names tend to translate into the Merchants' Tongue as concatenations of natural objects and events (Treeleaf, Shootingstar) or precious metals and gems (Coppereye, Goldenhill). In their natural form, Elvan names are lilting and soft, with many vowel and vowel-like sounds. Elves do not use patronymics and there is usually nothing in an Elf name to suggest who the Elf's parents are.

#### General Elf Racial Features

All Elf Jägers have the following Racial Features in addition to any Racial Features they may get for their individual sub-race:

- Dexterity +1
- Constitution -1
- Looks +1
- Medium Sized
- Base speed of 30'
- Listen Checks +2
- Search Checks +2
- Spot Checks +2
- Hide Checks +2
- Move Silent Checks +1
- Slight of Hand Checks +1
- Talent: Spot Secret Doors
- Open Lock Checks -1

The Elvish race split into five after the Kin Strife Wars and the Sundering. Although only four of the five sub-races are appropriate for use as a Player Jäger, each of the five sub-races is outlined below.

#### Amazonian Elf

Whether a separate race of Elvankind or simply an offshoot of High Elves, the Elves of Amazonia Isle have distinctive features and characteristics. Other than the distinctive attributes described below, Amazonian Elves conform closely to the characteristics of High Elves and of Elvankind in general.

Amazonian Elves live on the island of Amazonia, off the northwest coast of Gervia. During the Kin Strife Wars this group of mainly female Elves were horrified at the bloodshed being wrought by their fellows and so sought a land far away from the warring factions of their kin. They ended up on Amazonia and in the thousands of Turnings since have effectively developed into a separate race.

All Amazonian Elves are female (as are their Half-Elf offspring). Male offspring of Amazonian Elves are generally abandoned in nearby island and mainland communities, where they are regarded as High Elves. This does not happen very often, as only about one child in ten is male.

Amazonian Elves are as tall as most Humans, but thin with sharp and pointed features. They retain the Elfish slimness. Their hair is pale yellow in the summer, darkening to a rich gold in the winter months. They dress in blues and greens, usually in garments that are loose and flowing. When necessary, Amazonian Elves can pass as Humans. (Indeed, it is rumoured that the Amazonian Elves have spies and assassins arrayed in a network stretching across most of Gervia.) Like most other Elves, their preferred weapons are the bow and the longsword or rapier. Many Amazonian Elves own and wear suits of Chain Mail.

Amazonian Elves are most often encountered in small Squads and Platoons. Magic choice and weapon use is generally coordinated. (For example: A wall of sword-wielding she-Elves will protect a second rank of Archers and a third rank of she-Elves wielding offensive Magic.) However, once such simple coordination is worked out, Amazonian Elves have no feel for tactics. Warriors, particularly those carrying swords, are not inclined to worry much about group tactics in combat; each warrior's tactics are intelligent and well thought out, but they may not mesh well with the intelligent plans of her neighbour.

Amazonian Elves are excellent horsewomen, though they do not ride other mounts. They rarely fight from horseback, preferring instead to act as Dragoons;riding up to a foe, dismounting and engaging on foot.

Occasionally, a visitor stumbles onto one of the bands of Amazonian Elves settled among the bays of Gervia. The Amazonians are fiercely protective of their chosen way of life and so they attack with intent to capture the males and take them home to the Isle to provide the next generation of Amazonian Elves.

Amazonian Elves are by nature reclusive and predisposed to resent most other races, except Gnomes, whom they tolerate. Other Elves dislike Amazonian Elves, believing that they sold out their kin by abandoning the Kin Strife Wars. They are also less than enthusiastic about the Amazonian Elves views on males and male children.

The culture of the Amazonian Elves has definite real-world Ancient Greece overtures - primarily real-world Sparta, but with some real-world Athenian values mixed in. Amazonian Elves are generally Chaotic Good in Alignment.

##### Amazonian Elf Racial Features

Amazonian Elf Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Elf Racial Features listed above:

- Intelligence +1
- Magic Resistance: Level+11 vs. *Sleep* and enchantment Magic
- Talent: Low-Light Vision
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Longsword or Racial Weapon: Rapier
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Longbow
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Shortbow
- Languages: Competent Elf: Amazonian, Intermediate Merchants' Tongue

#### Aquatic Elf

Aquatic Elves are a race of Elves that live in the sea. Whether this was a natural state for their ancestors or whether they were somehow enchanted so as to be able to live in the sea, Aquatic Elves have done so for as long as anyone can remember. Aquatic Elves are normally Chaotic-Neutral in Alignment.

Aquatic Elves are not a suitable race for Player Jägers.

#### Dark Elf

the Kin Strife Wars, the Dark Elves or Drow have become
all that was folly with the Sundering. Now, mothers warn their children to be good or the Dark Elves will come and spirit them away. Dark Elves have turned their backs on the surface world, instead finding beauty in the nature of the Underdark. Thoroughly Evil, they only venture back to the surface to either make war on their Elvan cousins or to trade with those that are as Evil as themselves.

##### Dark Elf Racial Features

Dark Elf Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Elf Racial Features listed above:

- Intelligence +1
- Charisma +1
- Magic Abilities: 1/day - *Dancing Lights*, *Darkness* and *Faerie Fire* as a Wizard of the Drow's Level
- Magic Resistance: Level+11
- Will Saves +2 vs. Magic and Magic-like abilities
- Talent: Extended Infravision
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Shortsword or Racial Weapon: Rapier
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Crossbow
- Languages: Competent Elf: Dark, Competent Sign, Intermediate Undercommon
- Flaws: Day Blind plus 2 Others

#### High Elf

The best known of the High Elf kingdoms is Evergreen, a vast forest realm on the lower slops of the Worldspine Mountains to the east south-east of Deepharbour. It is rumoured that Lord and Lady Treeholm, the king and queen of Evergreen and the rulers of the tree city Treeholm, are the most noble of all the High Elves and that all other High Elvan monarchs defer to them and owe allegiance to them. No non-Elf has ever been able to confirm this rumour, but the fact remains that Treeholm is the place where High Elves most commonly meet official delegations from other races.

##### High Elf Racial Features

High Elf Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Elf Racial Features listed above:

- Magic Resistance: Level+11 vs. *Sleep* and enchantment Magic.
- Talent: Low-Light Vision.
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Longsword or Racial Weapon: Rapier.
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Longbow.
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Shortbow.
- Languages: Competent Elf: High, Intermediate Merchants' Tongue.

#### Wood Elf

During the Kin Strife Wars it was the Wood Elves who fought in the thickest forests and woods and after the Sundering these Elves became a permanent part of the wildest and deepest forests, shunning most of the outside world. Only the Wild Elves are more dangerous to those who would harm the woods.

##### Wood Elf Racial Features

Wood Elf Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Elf Racial Features listed above:

- Strength +1
- Dexterity +1
- Intelligence -1
- Charisma -1
- Magic Resistance: Level+11 vs. *Sleep* and enchantment Magic
- Talent: Low-Light Vision
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Longsword or Racial Weapon: Spear
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Longbow
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Shortbow
- Languages: Competent Elf: Wood, Intermediate Merchants' Tongue

### Gnome

Gnomes, like Dwarves, are also analogous to real-world Celts, but instead of having a real-world Scottish leaning Gnomes more closely follow the real-world Irish. Gnomes do not generally use patronymics, instead having a family or clan name. In addition to the sample list of Gnomish names below (by no means complete), any real-world Irish sounding name is suitable for a Gnome.

#### General Gnome Racial Features

All Gnome Jägers have the following Racial Features in addition to any Racial Features they may get for their individual sub-race:

- Strength -1
- Looks -1
- Small Sized
- Base speed of 20'
- Talent: Racial Enemy: Kobolds
- Talent: Giant Dodge
- Listen Checks +2
- Alchemy Checks +2
- Spot Checks +2
- Disable Device Checks +2
- Move Silent Checks +1
- Open Lock Checks +1
- Climb Checks -3

The Gnomish race split into two following the Sundering. Both of these sub-races are described below.

#### Deep Gnome

##### Deep Gnome Racial Features

Deep Gnome Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Gnome Racial Features listed above:

- Dexterity +1
- Wisdom +1
- Charisma -2
- Saving Throws +2
- Talent: Extended Infravision
- Talent: Stonecunning
- *Non-Detection*: as per the Hex Cast by a Wizard of the Gnome's Level
- Hide Check +2, +4 in dark underground areas
- Magical Ability: *Blindness*, *Blur* and *Change Self*, each 1/day as a Wizard of the Gnome's Level
- Languages: Competent Gnome: Deep, Intermediate Undercommon
- Flaws: Any 3

#### Rock Gnome

Almost all Gnomes encountered anywhere on the surface on Cartivus will be Rock Gnomes. Firm allies of the Dwarves, they have fared better than their larger cousins, probably because Rock Gnomes have never formed themselves into great kingdoms like the Dwarves did and so have not suffered as much throughout the Turnings. Rock Gnomes can be found almost anywhere where there are hills and woods, including near Dwarf settlements and in Human cities.

##### Rock Gnome Racial Features

Rock Gnome Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Gnome Racial Features listed above:

- Constitution +1
- Talent: Low-Light Vision
- Saving Throws +1 vs. Illusions
- Talent: Racial Enemy: Greenskins
- Magic Ability: *Speak With Animals* 1/day (burrowing animals only) as a 1<sup>st</sup> level Wizard
- Magic Ability: *Dancing Lights*, *Ghost Sound* and *Prestidigitation*, each 1/day as a 1<sup>st</sup> level Wizard, provided the Gnome's Intelligence is `0+`
- Languages: Competent Gnome: Rock, Intermediate Merchants' Tongue

### Halfling

by a wanderlust that causes them to move around in
brightly covered caravans, never staying in one spot too long. These are the Vladiskmir and a little under half of the individuals making up the Vladiskmir will be Halflings (the rest will be Half-Elves and Humans, with maybe a smattering of other races thrown in).

The remainder of the Halfling race can be found scattered in small communities across Gervia. Some have taken up residence in Human communities, while some just find a quite corner of the world and live out their days peacefully. As they generally shun Evil, there are no known Halfling communities within the Great Empire. The best know Halfling community (indeed, probably the only one which could be considered a kingdom) is the area of land known as the Three Shires, located south of Evergreen.

Halflings are most analogues to the people populating the real-world shires and counties of southern England. Halfling family names generally follow the Elvan model, but are generally simpler and more down to earth, such as Underhill, Hightree and Greenmedow (when translated into the Merchants' Tongue). Their given names tend to be short, with only one or two syllables; female given names tend to be flowers. All Halflings have a great interest in genealogy and some of the best Heralds around are Halflings.

#### General Halfling Racial Features

All Halfling Jägers have the following Racial Features in addition to any Racial Features they may get for their individual sub-race:

- Strength -1
- Dexterity +1
- Small Sized
- Base speed of 20'
- Climb Check +2
- Hide Check +2
- Listen Check +2
- Move Silently Check +2
- Disable Device Check +1
- Saving Throws +1, +2 vs. fear
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Sling
- Talent: Racial Weapon: Thrown Weapons
- Climb Check -3
- Languages: Intermediate Merchants' Tongue

The Halfling race has four distinct branches.  Although only three of the four sub-races are appropriate for use as a Player Jäger, each of the four sub-races is outlined below.

#### Jerren

Jerren are not a suitable race for Player Jägers.

#### Hairfoot

##### Hairfoot Halfling Racial Features

Hairfoot Halfling Jägers have the following Racial Features in addition to the General Halfling Racial Features listed above:

- Climb Check +2 (cumulative with the General Halfling Racial Feature for an overall Climb Check of -1)
- Languages: Competent Halfling: Hairfoot

Half-Elf Jägers have the following Racial Features:

- Looks +1
- Medium Sized
- Base speed of 30'
- Listen Checks +1
- Search Checks +1
- Spot Checks +1
- Hide Checks +1
- Slight of Hand Checks +2

- Elvan Blood: For all purposes Half-Elves can be considered as Elves.
- Languages: Intermediate Merchants' Tongue, either a Gervian Human dialect or an Elf dialect, depending on the Jäger's background, to Competent level

### Half Orc

#### Half-Orc Racial Features

Half-Orc Jägers have the following Racial Features:

- Strength +1
- Intelligence -1
- Charisma -1
- Looks -1
- Medium Sized
- Base speed of 30'
- Talent: Infravision
- Languages: Intermediate Merchants' Tongue, either a Gervian Human dialect or Orc, depending on the Jäger's background, at Competent level

### Human - Gervian

Humans are the most populous race in Gervia. As such, Human culture has spread over most of the continent and so the physical nature of the various Human sub-races are diverse. Gervian Humans run the full gamut of size, physical characteristics, culture and temperaments, although, as a race, they tend to be thought of as Chaotic-Neutral in Alignment.

There are seven Gervian Human sub-races, each described below.

#### Gervian Human Racial Features

Gervian Human Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to any Racial Features they may get for their individual sub-race:

- Medium Sized.
- Base speed of 30'.
- 1 extra Talent at each Level Group.
- 4 extra Skill Points at 1<sup>st</sup> Level.
- 1 extra Skill Point at each Level beyond 1<sup>st</sup>.
- Languages: Intermediate Merchants' Tongue.

#### Armen

The Armen originated in the vast plains of central Gervia. This sub-race of Humans rose to found the greatest empire seen in modern Gervia and so the Armen sub-race is probably the most widely spread.

Armen stand around 5&frac34; feet tall and weigh around 175 pounds. They tend to have blond hair, but brown and red hair are not unknown. Their skin is usually pale, ranging from lightly tanned to fair and they have blue, green or occasionally hazel eyes. Some Armen men grow neat, trimmed beards, often following the jaw-line up to join the sideburns, while others prefer to go bare chinned, while still others grow moustaches which they wax.

Armen are most closely analogous to real-world Germans and Romans and they are what the peoples of real-world Central and Western Europe would have been like if the real-world Germans had not defeated the real-world Romans in the real-world 2<sup>nd</sup>and 3<sup>rd</sup> Centuries AD. They use patronymics in a similar way to the Dwarves, with the word "Von" replacing the Dwarven word "Mac" and they are more likely to use a clan or family name than a father's name for their  patronymic. Any good real-world German sounding name is appropriate for use as an Armen name.

As the Great Empire has turned from its righteous path towards Evil, those of Armen descent who have severed their ties with the Empire, such as the East Province and the Grand Duchy of Deepharbour, tend to use the word "Van" instead of "Von" and so Armen from these parts of Gervia tend to have more real-world Dutch sounding names.

##### Armen Racial Features

Armen Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Gervian Human Racial Features listed above:

- Diplomacy Check +2
- Languages: Competent Human: Armen

#### Drazi

The Drazi are a mystery. The Drazi sub-race is found in two separate places in Gervia and there seems to be no record of the two branches of the Drazi having ever met. Still, even though separated by many thousands of leagues, both the Ost-Drazi (the Drazi from the West) and the Visi-Drazi (the Drazi from the East) are definitely from the same roots.

The Drazi usually stand about 5&frac12; feet tall and weigh around 165 pounds. They have light brown skin, dark brown or black hair and brown eyes. Drazi favour loose flowing robes and wraps and cover their heads with sheets of cloth held back from their eyes by thin ropes wrapped five times around the head. Drazi women often wear a veil. Drazi men favour goatee beards.

The Ost-Drazi hail from the desert lands on the West Coast of Gervia. Here they have built the very old kingdom of Memfine, ruled by their king, known as Pharaoh. Memfine boosts many tombs and pyramids and is also famous for Memfine Fire Oil, a gooey substance that burns with a white hot flame, even in water. Ost- Drazi are most analogues to real-world Ancient Egyptians.

The Visi-Drazi inhabit the desert country on the East Coast of Gervia. Here they roam the sands in tribes ruled over by their kings known as Sultans. The Visi-Drazi are known as shrewd traders and many races know of the Visi-Drazi from the market places of the world. The Visi-Drazi are most analogues to real-world Arabs.

All the Drazi use patronymics, with the word "Bin" meaning "Child of". Unlike the Armen, Drazi names are never made up of a clan or family name; only the father's name with "Bin" attached is ever used as the patronymic. Drazi of great renown or of noble blood do remember their father's full name and sometimes even their grandfather's and their great-grandfather's. This can lead to names such as Mohamed Bin Rashtan Bin Laden Bin Sotan. Any good real-world Middle-Eastern name is a good one to use for a Drazi.

##### Drazi Racial Features

Drazi Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Gervian Human Racial Features listed above:

- Appraise Check +2
- Languages: Competent Human: Drazi

#### Frokki

Frokki are a sub-race of Humans who live in the line of mountains known as The Wall, to the far north of Gervia. They are a fierce people to match their fierce environment. Frokki usually stand about 6&frac12; tall and weigh 195 pounds. Their skin is almost always fair and they get sunburnt easily in warmer climates, so they are often pink when seen by others. Frokki have blond or red hair and their eyes are green or sometimes blue.

Frokki raid into the Empire and via the Sea of Sorrows into the East Province. They have also been known to launch their Longships and raid Amazonian and Memfine and rarely they will raid as far south as Deepharbour.

Frokki are a vibrant people. They love to laugh, they love to love and they love to fight. When this aggressive personality is matched by the Frokki's large frame, the effect shocks most peace loving or refined races.

Frokki prefer simple log homes large enough for their extended family. They prefer working with their hands and many Frokki distrust Magic and those who wield it. They are also disdainful of scholars and scholarship. Frokki burn their dead on great pyres or set them adrift in burning Longships, surrounded by the best processions the Frokki had in life.

Frokki most resemble real-world Norse and their names are often Norse-like in sound. Like most other races, Frokki use patronymics, with the word "son" added to the end of their fathers name (if they are male) or the word "daughtar" add to the end of their mother's (if they are female). Frokki also always attach their tribe's name to the end (usually named after the tribe's founder), proceeded by "of the Tribe". Thus, an example of a male Frokki name might be Erik Bjornsson of the Tribe Sven, while his sister might be called Unala Oslisdaughtar of the Tribe Sven. Thus, we now know that Erik's father Bjorn married Unala's mother Osli and they all belong to the tribe founded by someone called Sven.

##### Frokki Racial Features

Frokki Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Gervian Human Racial Features listed above:

- Strength +1
- Intelligence -1
- Charisma -1
- Survival: Cold Checks +2
- Languages: Competent Human: Frokki

#### Hzun

The area of Gervia known as the Free Cities, to the east and south-east of Deepharbour along the eastern edge of Jenkal Bay, is the land of the Hzun. Smaller  than the Armen, the Hzun stand about 5&frac12; feet tall and weigh around 165 ponds. They have olive skin, black or dark brown hair and brown or hazel eyes.

Once part of the Great Empire, the Hzun now live in separate Baronies, Counties, Earldoms and Duchies, not to mention independent villages and hamlets, all independent and looking out for themselves. This is very similar to the real-world situation that occurred in the Middle Ages to Italy and Spain and thus the Hzun most closely resemble the real-world Italians and Spanish. This state of affairs has given the Hzun a natural ability to gather information and some of the best spy networks in Gervia are of Hzun origin.

The Hzun do not use patronymics, instead having family names that are passed down from generation to generation along the father's line. Real-world Italian or Spanish names are good ones for Hzun.

##### Hzun Racial Features

Hzun Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Gervian Human Racial Features listed above:

- Gather Information Checks +2
- Languages: Competent Human: Hzun

#### Justean

The Justean inhabit the area of land on the opposite side of Jenkal Bay to the Hzun, in the Kingdoms of Venture, Stasiland and Dermara and the Old Kingdom of Endremin, as well as the small independent settlements along the Promjar Peninsula. Similar to the Armen in size, Justean have darker skin than their northern neighbours, but similar eye and hair colour to the Hzun. Justean noses are very distinct, being very aristocratic in nature. Their jaws tend to be square as well.

Being dominated by the Kingdom of Venture and its vassal Stasiland, the Justean are fine warriors and every Justean knows some military knowledge.

The Justeans are most closely analogous to real-world medieval French, particularly the real-world kingdom of Charlemagne. They place a great deal of emphasis on honour and chivalry, coming second only to the East Province in these traits.

The Justeans, like their cousins the Hzun, do not use patronymics, but use a family name instead. Any real- world French sounding name is appropriate for a Justean.

##### Justean Racial Features

Justean Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Gervian Human Racial Features listed above:

- Knowledge: Military Checks +2
- Languages: Competent Human: Justean

#### Numeanor

Numeanor is a large, sea-based kingdom lying to the south-west of Venture and Damara. Its people are uniformly dark of skin, black of hair and brown of eye. They stand about 6 feet tall and weigh around 185 pounds. They favour bright colours and often go around barefoot when not wearing their high sea boots. All Numeanors are excellent sailors.

Numeanor culture is old and rich. The people are informal and strangers are greeted warmly, while guests are treated like royalty. Bargaining is hard, but both parties are respectful and polite. The practice of a dowry is still alive and shows no sign of being abandoned soon. Numeanor bury their dead at sea.

Real-world Jamaica is the closest analogue to Numeanor and any suitable real-world Jamaican sounding name is appropriate to use for a Numeanor. Most Numeanor names are simple affairs, with patronymics and/or family names replaced by nicknames or deed names (names derived from a particular event of action taken by the owner).

##### Numeanor Racial Features

Numeanor Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Gervian Human Racial Features listed above:

- Rope Use Checks +2
- Languages: Competent Human: Numeanor

#### Thoft

The Thoft have brown hair and eyes and their skin ranges from copper to darker tan. They stand about the same height as the Armen, most often around 5&frace34; feet, but are slimmer, weighing around 160 pounds.

The Thoft inhabit a series of concentric plateaus located to the northwest of Numeanor and south of Memfine and their culture, which promotes Magic above all others, has a distinctly real-world Aztec and/or Mayan aspect to it. Their leaders are known as White Wizards and the White Wizards of Thoft are some of the most powerful Magecasters in all of Gervia.

Thoft most closely resembles real-world Russia in the Dark Ages, just after it was united (abet with the real-world Aztec/Mayan aspects mentioned above). While the Kingdom is ruled by a nobility led by a Tsar, it is the White Wizards, acting as advisers, who really run the kingdom. Thoft names are distinctly real-world Russian in sound and Thoft use the suffix "ov" to denote "of the family of". Thoft names are always in three parts: the given name, the father's given name with a suffix of "vich" (meaning "son of") and the family name always ending in "ov". An example is Vladimire Ivanovich Krashtikov: Vladimire the son of Ivan of the family Krashtik.

##### Thoft Racial Features

Thoft Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to the General Gervian Human Racial Features listed above:

- Strength -1
- Intelligence +1
- Magecraft Checks +2
- Languages: Competent Human: Thoft

## The Races Of Orant

These are the races found on the continent of Orant who are appropriate for play as a Jäger.

### Hengeyokai

#### General Hengeyokai Racial Features

All Hengeyokai Jägers have the following Racial Features, in addition to any Racial Features they may get for their individual sub-race:

- Wisdom -1
- Looks -1
- Medium Sized (in Human Form)
- Base speed of 30' (in Human Form)
- Talent: Low-Light Vision (not in Human Form)
- Disguise Checks +10 (in Animal Form)
- Talent: Shapechanger - Hengeyokai can change shape, assuming one of three possible Forms. This ability functions like the Alter Self Spell, but a Hengeyokai can assume a Form a number of times per day equal to 1 plus his Level. Thus, a 1<sup>st</sup>level Hengeyokai can switch from Human Form to Animal Form and back again in a single day. A Hengeyokai's Animal Form is a normal animal of Small or smaller size. Equipment the Hengeyokai is wearing or carrying transforms to become part of the Animal Form; Magic Items cease functioning while the Hengeyokai is in Animal Form. In Animal Form, the Hengeyokai has the supernatural ability to communicate with animals of its kind. This is the same as a Familiar's ability to speak with animals of its type (see Chapter XX - Professions). Hengeyokai have the size, speed, AC, damage rating and physical ability scores of their sub-race while in Animal Form (not cumulative with their Human or Hybrid Forms). Hengeyokai in Hybrid Form retain their ability to communicate with animals of their type. Their physical characteristics are based on their abilities in Human Form, modified by their sub-race. In this Form, a Hengeyokai can typically wear light or medium armour without modification, but wearing heavy armour is impossible. Equipment worn or carried by a Hengeyokai in Human Form does not transform when the Hengeyokai assumes Hybrid Form. When a Hengeyokai in Animal Form assumes Hybrid Form, his equipment returns to its normal appearance and Magic Items resume their functioning.

## Other Peoples Of Gervia And Orant

Many barbarians inhabit the world of Cartivus. Apart from the Ice Barbarians of Gervia (primarily Frokki), many primitive peoples live in the jungles and other remote places of Cartivus' two main continents. Most of these can be treated as Numeanor or Hzun Humans if from the islands and jungles of tropical Gervia; or Thoft, Armen or other Gervian Humans if from elsewhere in Gervia. In Orant, while all of these types of peoples are considered hinin, all of them can trace ancestry back to one of the nine Clans and so can be considered as such; typically a Clan residing in the same geographical area.

## The Races Of Swalu

Although not strictly eligible for use as Jägers, the GM may allow one or two individuals to come from Cartivus' southernmost continent of Swalu. The Humans of Swalu most closely resemble Hzun or Numeanor Humans, while the Dwarves have a legend of a lost Mountain Dwarf Clan who travelled down the World Spine Mountains to the land across the sea many ages ago.

If any Elves exist on Swalu they would most likely be Wood Elves, or perhaps Dark Elves who have re-surfaced in these southern lands. It would also not be too surprising to discover a long lost Vladiskmir tribe of Halflings. Orcs, of course, are a plague upon the whole world, so discovering Orcs and Half-Orcs in the jungles of Swalu would not be unreasonably. However, this is all speculation and the final decision would be up to the GM.

## Cross-Breeds

As has been alluded too above, it is possible for at least some of Cartivus' diverse races to inter-breed. From the Jägers' point of view this is most important in determining their own ancestry, and the following outlines whom can breed with whom and what race the resulting offspring will be.

As a general rule the creatures of Cartivus cannot inter-breed with each other without some outside influence, such as Magic. Thus, creatures such as the dreaded Owlbear are almost always the result of some mad Wizard's blasphemous experiments, or the will of some malevolent Immortal power.

Orcs, however, are an exception to this rule: Orcs can, will and do breed with just about anything Humanoid. The resulting offspring is invariable classed as a Half-Orc and, as has been stated above, it is only about 10% of these Half-Orcs who are actually sufficiently superior to be eligible for selection as a Jäger; all others are little more then bastardised Orcs themselves.

Most other species of Humanoid can intra-breed with members of their race's other sub-races: the resulting offspring will be the sub-race of one of the parents and the resulting sub-race will then "breed true" - no trace of the other parent's sub-race will be found. Culturally, most of the civilised races frown on breeding between a race's sub-races, with various communities holding views ranging from being completely taboo through to marrying one's cousin through to something that happens but isn't talked about much.

Dwarves cannot breed with any other race, apart from Orcs and Half-Orcs (discussed below). Dwarf/Orc Half-Orcs tend to be stockier and shorter than other Half-Orcs and are always infertile.

Gnomes and Halflings are similar to Dwarves: they can breed with Orcs but the resulting Gnome/Orc and Halfling/Orc Half-Orcs are never in the top percentile and so are never eligible for use as Jägers.

Hengeyokai cannot intra-breed with other Hengeyokai sub-races, nor can they breed with Humans or with any other species.

Korobokuru cannot inter-breed with the other races of Orant and there have been no known matings between Korobokuru and Orcs: if such a mating were possible it is conjectured by the sages that the results would be the same as for Gervian Dwarves and Orcs. Korobokuru and Dwarves also cannot inter-breed.

Spirit Folk are, by definition, the descendants of spirits and Humans. When a Spirit Folk mates with a Human the Spirit Folk "breeds true" and thus the offspring of such unions are always Spirit Folk themselves. Like Hengeyokai, Spirit Folk cannot intra-breed with other Spirit Folk sub-races.

Because Orantal Humans are divided by Clan affiliation rather than by sub-race per say, when Orantal Humans intra-breed with other Orantal Humans the child is considered to be the same Clan as the one he is brought up in; typically that of the father as most Orantal Human communities are patriarchal in nature. Orantal and Gervian Human pairings do occur, with the offspring following the racial characteristics of one or the other of the parents.

Gervian Humans can intra-breed with other Gervian Human sub-races and with Orcs: both circumstances following the normal patterns and both are covered above.

Half-Orcs can breed with Humans and with Half-Elves (discussed below) but not Elves; they can also breed with Dwarves. Dwarf/Half-Orc unions produce Half-Orcs and, like Dwarf/Orc unions, such offspring are infertile.

Elves follow the typical pattern when and if they intra-breed with other Elvan sub-races. The exception is Amazonian Elves: as has been stated above there are no male Amazonian Elves and fully nine children in ten born to Amazonian mothers are female, the remaining male children being considered High Elves. Elves cannot breed with Orcs. Humans, on the other hand, can breed with Elves, and the resulting Half-Elvan race has been discussed above.

Half-Elves can breed with Elves, Human and Half-Orcs, but not Orcs.

The interactions of the different races can become quite complex, but the following should help to make things clear:

- To be considered an Elf an individual must have at least fifteen parts in sixteen of Elvan blood (93.75%). This means that out of all of an individual's Great-Great-Grandparents only one can be Human; all the rest must be Elvan.
- If an individual has less than 93.75% but at least 50% Elvan blood then they are Half-Elvan.
- If an individual has at least 50% Orc blood then they are Half-Orc.
- If an individual has more than 50% Human blood or they have 50% Human blood and more than one other race in their ancestry then they are Human.

Table 5-1: Mixed Race Offspring, below, summarises this information. One parent's race is shown along the top and the other is shown in the first column: the intersection lists the race of the child.

Table 5-2: Extended Mixed Race Families, below, lists the closest relationship two individuals could have, based on their race; Siblings are closer than Half-Siblings and Half-Siblings are closer than Half-Cousins. If two individuals could be Half-Siblings then they could be Cousins instead.

###### Table 5-2: Extended Mixed Race Families

## Racial Demographics

It's all well and good to talk about each of the races individually, but how numerous a given race is in comparison to the others reveals much about the character of the race's members. The racial demographics of Cartivus need to be broken up into two: the demographics of Gervia and the demographics of Orant. After much study and conjecture the sages of Cartivus have determined the following demographic percentages for Cartivus's races (at least for the surface of this world). All percentages are given to two decimal places (rounded off).

### Gervia Demographics

Gervian Humans make up the majority of the Gervian races, accounting for 58.1% of the population. Of the Humans, 23.8% are Armen, 12.9% are Drazi, 5.7% are Frokki, 15.7% are Hzun, 18.3% are Justean, 20.4% are Numeanor and 3.2% are Thoft.

Half-Elves are the second most numerous race in Gervia, accounting for 10.3% of all Gervians, while Half-Orcs account for 5.6% and are the fifth largest race.

Dwarves are the third most numerous race in Gervia and account for some 9.4% of Gervians. Within their own race, Hill Dwarves are the most common with 57.7% and Mountain Dwarves come in a close second with 42.3% of the Dwarf population.

7.8% of the Gervian population are Elvish, making the Elves the fourth largest of the Gervian races. Of these, 10.9% are Amazonian Elf, 0.3% are Dark Elf, 60.1% are High Elf and 28.7% are Wood Elf. The number of Aquatic Elves are unknown and are no included in any of these figures.

The sixth largest Gervian race is the Halflings, whom number 4.3% of Gervians, broken down within their own Race into: 39.4% Hairfoots, 35.7% Stouts and 24.9% Tallfellows. The number of Jerren are unknown and are not included in any of these figures.

Gnomes run a close seventh behind the Halflings and make up 4.2% of the Gervian population, with Deep Gnomes accounting for 1.7% of the Gnomish race and 98.3% being Rock Gnomes.

Finally, it is possible to find Orant races in Gervia, mostly traders and wanders, although they make up only 0.3% of the Gervian population. Individually Orant races have the same demographics in Gervia as they do in Orant.

Note that the figures for Cave Dwarves, Dark Elves and Deep Gnomes are what can be expected on the surface. In the Underdark these creatures are vastly more prevalent.

### Orant Demographics

Of Orantal races, Orantal Humans are by far the largest race (in terms of numbers) than any other, in Orant or in Gervia. The Humans of Orant account for 82.3% of the Orantal population, with the individual Clans as follows: Crab Clan: 9.4%, Crane Clan: 7.8%, Dragon Clan: 14.3%, Jaguar Clan: 9.9%, Lion Clan: 10.1%, Mantis Clan: 8.3%, Phoenix Clan: 13.1%, Scorpion Clan: 14.2%, Unicorn Clan: 12.9%.

Hengeyokai account for 3.7% or the Orantal races. Within their race the ten individual sub-races are practically evenly distributed, each forming approximately 10% of the overall Hengeyokai Race.

Korobokuru make up 10.1% of Orant, while Spirit Folk account for 3.9% of Orantal Races. Within their race, Bamboo Spirit Folk account for 22.7%, Mountain Spirit Folk Account for 20.4%, River Spirit Folk Account for 23.3% and Sea Spirit Folk account for 33.6%.

In addition, it is possible to find Gervians in Orant. Gervians make up &frac12;% of the population of Orant and like their Orant cousins in Gervia are mostly traders, wanders and explorers. Individually, the Gervian races have the same demographics in Orant as they do in Gervia.

### Demographic Summary

Table 6-3: Racial Demographics, below, summarises all of the demographic percentages for all of the Races, in both Gervia and Orant. The "Within Race" percentages can be generated by rolling d1,000/10, while the "In Gervia" and "In Orant" percentages can be generated by rolling d10,000/100.

## Physical Characteristics

Table 6-4: Racial Heights And Weights through to Table 5-7: Eye Colour summarise the various physical characteristics of all of the Player Races of Cartivus. Each table is included with a brief description.

### Height And Weight

Table 6-4: Racial Heights And Weights, below, is used to determine the height and weight of an individual. Either choose an appropriate height and weight from those values given or roll the appropriate dice to determine an individual's height and weight randomly.

First determine the height by rolling the dice indicated in the Height Roll column. Make note of this number. Add this number to the figure given in the Height column to give the final height of the individual. Next, roll the indicated dice in the Weight Roll column and then multiply this number by the number noted down for the Height Roll. Add the product of these two numbers to the number given in the Weight column to give the final weight of the individual.

Note that the figures before the slash is for males while the figures after the slash is for females.

### Age

Table 6-5: Starting Age, below, is used to determine the starting age of an individual. Either choose an appropriate age from those values given or roll the appropriate dice to determine an individual's starting age randomly. Note that it is possible to play an Jäger whose age is outside these indicated ranges, but only with the GM's approval.

To determine the starting age of an individual you must known what Class (see Chapter X: Professions) the individual is. If the individual is starting his career Multiclassed, use the Class with the largest number of age dice.

Determine the starting age by rolling the dice indicated in the relevant Class column, then add this number to the age given in the Adulthood column.

To determine the birth date of an individual, first roll 1d1000. If the roll is 3 or less than the individual was born on Midsummerday. On any other result, roll 1d10 to determine the birth month and then roll 1d30 and ignore any value greater than 28 to determine the birth day within that month. Note that 1d30 is the same as (1d3-1)\10+1d10.

It should be noted that an Jägerwyrm Turning is approximately 7/9 as long as a real-world year and so all ages given in Turnings are only 7/9 as old when converting to real-world years.

Table 6-6: Age Categories, below, gives an indication of the general Age Categories and how old an individual of each race would be to belong to each category. Note that at Middle Age, Old and Venerable the individual gains INT +1 and WIS +1 (cumulatively), but looses STR -1, DEX -1 and CON -1 (cumulatively).

### Size

All creatures (and things) belong to a Size Category. Table 5-8: Size Categories, below, lists the Size Categories used, along with how much space something of that size takes up (primarily in combat) known as Facing, as well as the Natural Reach of a creature that size and an AC and Attack Modifier (see Chapter X - Conflictology for details of how these values are used).

For sizes larger than Fhugh 2 (Fhugh 3, Fhugh 4, etc) simply double the Size Range, Modifier and Facing values of the previous size, multiply the Weight Range values by 4 and add 5' to the Natural Reach.

Weight assumes a creature with a density roughly the same as a normal animal. Creatures and objects made of stone will weigh considerably more, while gaseous creatures will weigh less.

## Individual Pre-History

The final factor in determining the anthropology of an individual is the individual's pre-history and family background. The following set of tables allows these details to be determined. The best way to use them is to roll to determine the pre-history details, although these should be used as a guide, not necessarily as a strait-jacket.

### Home Community

Jägers need to choose a Homeland. Descriptions of the various lands and which Races can be found in the various lands can be found in Chapter X - Geography. Once an Adventure has chosen their Homeland its details will help determine some physical aspects of the home community, such as climate.

Once the size of the community that the individual grew up in has been
determined, go to section on Family and follow the rest of the tables in order to finish detailing the Jäger.

#### Home Community Terrain

Table 5-11: Home Community Terrain, below, will help determine the terrain of the individual's upbringing.
Note that the result from this table needs to be worked into the
descriptions of the individual's homeland - not every result will be
applicable to every individual.


###### Table 5-11: Home Community Terrain

|d20|Terrain|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-2|Desert|Any place where precipitation and vegetation are rare. This could anything from a sandy wasteland to a field of lava.|
|3-6|Plains|Mostly flat and often cultivated by nearby settlements.|
|7-9|Forest|Whether it's a tangled jungle or sparser pines, trees are the dominant feature of the landscape.|
|10-12|Hills|Includes highlands, cliff dwellings and any other rugged terrain.|
|13-14|Mountains|High altitude and rugged. Vegetation is sparse above the tree line, but forests and meadows predominate lower down.|
|15-16|Marsh|Includes swamps, moors and other low, wet areas.|
|17|Aquatic|Includes shipboard life and any island small enough that the dominant terrain feature is the sea that surrounds it.|
|18|Underground|The individual grew up in a subterranean community far beneath the surface world.|
|19-20|Nomadic|The individual doesn't have a specific home terrain because he migrated through more than one. If the Jäger has this type of background, work with the GM to determine what suitable choices might be for the migration.|

#### Home Community - Dwarf

Dwarf communities tend to centre on the mines that are central to the Dwarven economy. Table 5-12: Home Community - Dwarf, below, is the table used by Dwarves.

###### Table 5-12: Home Community - Dwarf

|d20|Size|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-2|Family Redoubt|The individual grew up on the edge of Dwarven civilisation, far from the rest of his clan.|
|3-4|Prospecting Camp|Anywhere from 5 to 20 Dwarves call these camps home. Often they represent an extended family attempting to strike it rich.|
|5-6|Small Mine|The mine could be mundane metals like iron or copper, precious stones like diamonds or something more exotic. Population ranges from 21 to 50 (4-10 families).|
|7-9|Large Mine|Up to 200 Dwarves (40 families) work a mine of this size.|
|10-13|Delve|A delve includes a large mine, forge and smithy. Up to 500 Dwarves (100 families) live here.|
|14-18|Large Delve|Like a Delve, but with more extensive structures and a population of up to 2,000 (400 families).|
|19-20|Human Area|Dwarves raised in non-Dwarf settlements may be subject to unfair prejudice from their fellows for being "contaminated" by outside ways. Determine the community size on Table 6-18: Home Community - Human.|

#### Home Community - Elf

Elves are creatures of the forest (or of the deep Underdark, in the case of Dark Elves). They live in quiet places far from noisy Human settlements or dangerous Dwarven delves. Table 5-13: Home Community - Elf, below, is the table used by Elves.

###### Table 5-13: Home Community - Elf

|d20|Size|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-10|Encampment|These Elvan camps are at least semi-nomadic and support between 10 and 50 elves.|
|11-17|Village|When an Elvan village forms, it is often a loose grouping of related families or crafts rather than a regimented town like the Humans build. Population ranges from 50 to 100 Elves (10-20 families).|
|18-19|Elvan City|Only a handful of these cities exist. They are the centre of Elvan government. Between 2,000 and 5,000 Elves (400-1,000 families) call them home.|
|20|Human Area|For some reason, the individual's home is among Humans. Determine the community size on Table 6-18: Home Community - Human.|

#### Home Community - Gnome

Gnomes, a solitary people who pursue their own quiet studies and enjoyment of the wild, do not tend to group in large numbers. When they form clusters or gatherings, the area encompassed by the community will still be quite large to give every family a sense of space and privacy. Table 5-14: Home Community - Gnome, is the table used by Gnomes.

###### Table 5-14: Home Community - Gnome

|d10|Size|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1|Solitary Family|The individual's family has found solitude. Interesting question: Why did they crave it?|
|2-4|Cluster|Between 2 and 10 Gnome families form a loosely-knit cluster settlement. The total population can approach 50 Gnomes.|
|5-7|Gathering|Up to 1,000 Gnomes (200 families) call this "cluster of clusters" home.|
|8|Dwarven Area|The individual's family lives among the Dwarves. Determine the community size with on Table 6-12: Home Community - Dwarf.|
|9|Elvan Area|The individual's family lives among the Elves. Determine the community size with on Table 6-13: Home Community - Elf.|
|10|Human Area|The individual's family lives among the Humans. Determine the community size with on Table 6-18: Home Community - Human.|

#### Home Community - Halflings

Halflings are creatures of the meadows and light woods, although there is a reasonably strong streak of wanderlust within them. Most Halflings tend to ignore this desire to wonder, but some give in and become Vladiskmir. Table 5-15: Home Community - Halfling, below, is the table used by Halflings.

###### Table 5-15: Home Community - Halfling

|d10|Size|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-4|Vladiskmir|The individual grew up on the road with his extended family of up to 50 Halflings (and others).|
|5-6|Hamlet|Up to 500 Halflings (100 families) live in a hamlet.|
|7-8|Village|Up to 1,000 Halflings (200 families) live in a village.|
|9|Town|These towns are essentially villages that grew. Between 1,000 and 2,000 Halflings (200-400 families) live in a typical town.|
|10|Human Area|The individual's family lives among the Humans. Determine the community size with on Table 6-18: Home Community - Human.|

#### Home Community - Half-Elf

Apart, yet entangled with the worlds of their parents, Half-Elves never have an easy time finding a place to call their own. Those who do often find such a place outside the normal structures of member of either Human or Elf society. Table 5-16: Home Community - Half-Elf, below, is the table used by Half-Elves.

###### Table 5-16: Home Community - Half-Elf

|d10|Size|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-2|Vladiskmir|The individual grew up on the road with his extended family of up to 50 Half-Elves (and others).|

|7-10|Human Area|The individual's family lives among the Humans. Determine the community size with Table 6-18: Home Community - Human.|

#### Home Community - Half-Orc

Half-Orcs who are raised by an Orc parent may rise to great power in the Orc community, provided they can survive the rigours of childhood. Half-Orcs raised in Human communities are subject to a pervasive and unending prejudice. They are a constant reminder that Orc and Human are not as different as many would like to believe. Table 5-17: Home Community - Half-Orc, below, is the table used by Half-Orcs.

###### Table 5-17: Home Community - Half-Orc

|d20|Size|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-4|Fringe Community|These settlements consist of 5 to 50 Half-Orcs, Half-Elves and other mixed breeds and outcasts.|
|5-7|Orc Area|The individual's family lives among the Orcs. The GM will have further details about the Orc community.|
|8-20|Human Area|The individual's family lives among the Humans. Determine the community size with Table 6-18: Home Community - Human.|

#### Home Community - Human/Spirit Folk

Humans tend to have a rural background. If the individual is from a larger city, work with the GM to determine the nature and location of that city. Table 5-18: Home Community - Human, below, is the table used by Humans.

Spirit Folk should also use this table.

###### Table 5-18: Home Community - Human

|d20|Size|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1|Small Tribe|Life in the individual's tiny community centres around hunting and gathering, herding or subsistence farming. The tribe has 100 people or less.|
|2|Religious, Arcane, Monastic or Military Compound|These communities tend to be close-knit and focused on a single interest. Up to 200 people are found in these communities.|
|3-4|Frontier Homestead|Life on the frontier is spartan and dangerous, but it encourages self-sufficiency. Most homesteads include only one or two families.|
|5-7|Thorp|These small settlements are usually little more than a cluster of farmhouses. Population ranges from 20 to 100 (4-20 families).|
|8-11|Hamlet|Larger than thorps, hamlets have up to 400 people (80 families).|
|12-15|Village|The smallest community that will support a number of craftspeople. Population ranges from 400 to 1,000 (80-200 families).|
|16|Small Town|A town large enough to appear on most maps. Population up to 4,000 (800 families).|
|17|Large Town|Large towns serve as regional and provincial centres. Size ranges from 4,000 to 8,000 inhabitants (800-1,000 families).|
|18|Small City|With up to 12,000 residents (2,400 families), small cities are big enough to be the capitals of smaller nations.|
|19|Large City|The dominant city in a large country will typically have between 12,000 and 25,000 inhabitants (2,400-5,000 families).|
|20|Metropolis|Only the largest cities in the world have more than 25,000 residents (5,000+ families).|

#### Home Community - Hengeyokai

Hengeyokai are typically found on the fringes of Human-settled lands, where they can mingle in Human Form but retreat to solitude when they desire. Table 5-19: Home Community - Hengeyokai, below, is the table used by Hengeyokai.

###### Table 5-19: Home Community - Hengeyokai

|d10|Size|Description|

|6-7|Hamlet|Larger than thorps, hamlets have up to 400 people (80 families).|
|8-9|Village|The smallest community that will support a number of craftspeople. Population ranges from 400 to 1,000 (80-200 families).|
|10|Human Area|The individual's family lives among the Humans. Determine the community size with Yable 6-18: Home Community - Human.|

#### Home Community - Korobokuru

Korobokuru dwell in remote sites of great natural beauty, such as lush mountain valleys or sprawling tropical forests. They live in simple villages or camps and move only when the advance of Human settlements requires it. Table 5-20: Home Community - Korobokuru, below, is the table used by Korobokuru.

###### Table 5-20: Home Community - Korobokuru

|d20|Size|Description|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-10|Encampment|These camps are at least semi-nomadic and support between 10 and 50 Korobokuru.|
|11-15|Hamlet|Up to 100 Korobokuru (20 families) live in a hamlet.|
|16-19|Village|When a Korobokuru village forms, it is often a loose grouping of related families or crafts rather than a regimented town like the Humans build. Population ranges from 100 to 500 Korobokuru (20-100 families).|
|20|Human Area|For some reason, the individual's home is among Humans. Determine the community size on Table 6-18: Home Community - Human.|

### Family

It's said that you are who you are either because of your parents or in spite of your parents. Whichever is the case for the Jäger, few factors have a greater influence on him than his family.

Note that throughout this section, "family" is intended in the broadest possible sense. The individual's family might be his fellow island castaways, the other beggars in Fish-Eye Alley or the kindly monks who took him in as an orphan. In fact, one of the questions that should be asked as the following tables are used is "Who do I consider family, exactly?"

#### Social Standing

How do other people in the individual's community view his family? If his family is prominent, their social standing may extend to include surrounding areas or perhaps even the entire country!

Social Standing is important, as each Class (see Chapter X - Professions) requires a certain minimum Social Standing before an Jäger can take up that Class. If an Jäger does not have the required Social Standing then he can rely on his Honour being sufficiently high that he will be accepted into his chosen Class. If neither of these two routes are available, then he must find a patron (of the required Social Standing or better) willing to sponsor the Jäger. This is no easy thing, as most sponsors require something in return.

Table 5-22: Social Standing By Race, below, is the table used to determine Social Standing for each race. Once the Social Standing of the Jäger's family is known the Social Standing can be looked up on Table 5-21: Social Standing, below, where can be found the Family Honour modifier along with the Ancestry and Birthright Rolls and Die. The Ancestry Rolls/Die is used on Table 5-31: Ancestry. The number before the slash is the number of rolls to take on Table 5-31: Ancestry, while the number after the slash is the Die to use.

The Birthright Rolls/Die is used on Table 5-49: Birthrights. The number before the slash is the number of rolls to take on Table 5-49: Birthrights, while the number after the slash is the Die to use.

###### Table 5-21: Social Standing

|Social Standing|Family Honour|Ancestry Rolls/Die|Birthright Rolls/Die|Typical Members|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--|
|Outcaste (O)|-5|1/d6|1/d4|Slaves, Prisoners, Banished Individuals.|

#### Family Occupation

Which Social Standing an Jäger's family belongs to will have an effect on what his family's occupation is. The Player should choose an appropriate occupation for his family based on the typical members of his family's Social Standing and the results of various tables below.

#### Family Economic Status

How wealthy is the individual's family? While this information doesn't have any direct bearing on the wealth of an Jäger, it may be a useful bit of background information to help describe the Jäger's attitudes. It's also a good motivational hook for the GM.

Table 5-23: Family Economic Status, below, is used to determine the economic status of the individual's family.

###### Table 5-23: Family Economic Status

|d20|Economic Status|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-2|Refugee|After fleeing some calamity or war, the individual's family owns nothing and has no regular income.|
|3-7|Poor|Sometimes the individual's family had to beg for food and shelter. They own no property and income barely covers basic needs.|
|8-11|Moderate|The individual's family owns at least a small dwelling or can make rent payments without significant concern. The family's income slightly exceeds its needs.|
|12-14|Wealthy|The individual's family owns a dwelling and may own other property. Family income significantly exceeds basic needs.|
|15|Religious Order|The individual was raised as part of a religious order. While his "family" didn't have much direct income, it had access to resources through its church.|
|16|Arcane Order|As above, only the Magic of Wizards or Wu Jen likely provides the resources.|
|17|Monastic Order|An order of Monks have taken the individual's family in. They live a spartan existence and so does his family.|
|18|Wealth Unimportant|For some reason, the individual's family's economic status was difficult to measure. Perhaps he lived a solitary life on the frontier as a trapper or scout, living entirely off the land.|
|19-20|Military Support|The individual and his family are dependants of someone in the military (probably an officer). This means little direct income, but the army provides for his needs.|

#### Family Defence Readiness

When trouble comes knocking at the door, how will the individual's family respond? In areas where conflict is rare, military training may seem quite extraordinary, even distasteful. In areas where the threat of danger is real and constant, not being prepared is viewed as the worst kind of stupidity.

Dwarves in particular usually have some form of martial training due to the constant threat of danger from their underground dwellings.

Table 5-24: Family Defence Readiness, below, is used to determine the defensive readiness of the individual's family.

###### Table 5-24: Family Defence Readiness

|d20|Readiness|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-2|None|The individual's family has no ability to defend themselves.|
|3-4|Low|The individual's family maintains a low level of readiness including a few weapons and an occasional discussion of how to defend against raiders or low-level monsters.|
|4-8|Rudimentary|Most family members are versed in basics of using clubs, spears and knives in self-defence and defence of the family home.|
|9-11|Medium|The individual's family trains actively in matters martial and is prepared for combat with a few days of last-minute preparation.|
|12-14|High|Combat is a regular part of the lives of the individual's family. Most adult members are veterans of some combat and martial weapons and training are commonplace.|
|15-16|Outstanding|The individual's family has a tradition of military service and family members are taught from birth to be courageous and stalwart companions when battle is joined. The family armoury contains magic weapons and armour.|
|17-18|Hired|The individual's family relies on outside protection such as guards or mercenaries.|
|19|Magical|The individual's family relies on magical protection.|
|20|Mixed|The individual's family has no consistent pattern of preparedness. Some members are very prepared for combat, but others are unprepared or unwilling to fight.|

#### Family Private Ethics

Some families have a shared ethos that impacts the decisions and actions of their members. In general, small communities composed of relatives or near relatives rarely tolerate shady or Evil residents.

Table 5-25: Family Private Ethics, below, is used to determine the private ethics of the individual's family. Note that the modifiers to Family Honour only apply on a roll of 1-5 on Table 5-26: Family Public Ethics, below.

###### Table 5-25: Family Private Ethics

|d20|Private Ethics|Family Honour|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-5|Neutral|+0|The individual's family has neutral ethics or no consistent family ethical direction.|
|6-10|Fair|+1|The individual's family holds to the letter of contracts and agreements.|
|11-15|Good|+2|The individual's family is known for involvement in the community and acting to help others.|
|16-18|Untrustworthy|-1|The individual's family often tries to break agreements or recant promises.|
|19-20|Evil|-2|The individual's family takes actions detrimental to the community.|
  
#### Family Public Ethics

Regardless of what the actual ethics of the family may be, the perception in the community may differ due to a variety of circumstances.

Table 5-26: Family Public Ethics, below, is used to determine the public ethics of the individual's family.

###### Table 5-26: Family Public Ethics

|d10|Public Ethics|Family Honour|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-5|Normal|As Above|The individual's family's ethical reputation matches their private ethics.|
|6|Undeserved (Positive)|+2|The individual's family is has a better reputation than they deserve; it's clear the community has the wrong idea.|
|7|Undeserved (Negative)|-2|The individual's family is unfairly painted as cheats; it's clear the community has the wrong idea.|
|8|Recent Change|+0|Family policy has changed for better or worse, but the family's reputation has not yet been affected. Interesting question: How did the policy change and why?|
|9|Beyond Reproach|+3|Regardless of the individual's family's actual ethics, public opinion is so ingrained about his family that it's essentially unchangeable.|
|10|Beneath Contempt|-3|Regardless of the individual's family's actual ethics, public opinion is so ingrained about his family that it's essentially unchangeable.|

#### Family Religious Commitment

Does the individual's family have a specific religious commitment? If the answer to that question is "Yes", the obvious follow-up question is "To who?" The individual's family may worship a pantheon or a single patron deity. Remember that this represents the individual's family's religion, not necessarily his own.

Table 5-27: Family Religious Commitment, below, is used to determine the religious commitment of the individual's family.

###### Table 5-27: Family Religious Commitment

|d20|Religious Commitment|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-4|Neutral/Uninterested|The individual's family has an inconsistent family religious direction.|
|5-8|Strong|The individual's family is deeply committed to a patron deity (choose which one).|
|9-12|Historical|The individual's family has worshipped a patron deity (player choice) for Turnings but may not observe religious commitments consistently.|
|13-14|Enmity|The individual's family has a historical conflict with followers of a particular deity (decide which one).|
|15-16|Participatory|The individual's family is a part of a religious order.|
|17|Open Heretics|The individual's family believes in a religious movement considered heretical or dangerous by the community at large.|
|18|Hidden Heretics|As above, but the individual's family hides this commitment from the public.|
|19-20|Mixed|The individual's family openly venerates one deity while privately venerating another.|

#### Family Reputation

You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your relatives. Table 5-28: Family Reputation, below, describes how the community feels about the individual's family, based on the behaviour of its members.

This table overlaps a bit with Table 5-26: Family Public Ethics, because both of them answer the question "What do they think about the individual's family?" Once again, if wildly different answers are generated, brainstorm an unusual reason or simply roll again.

###### Table 5-28: Family Reputation

|d20|Reputation|Family Honour|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-8|Unknown|+0|The individual's family has no perceived character. Individuals are treated without regard to their family name.|
|9-11|Good|+2|The individual's family is known as stalwart companions.|
|12-13|Outstanding|+3|The individual's family is known to produce upstanding individuals but has an occasional bad apple.|
|14|A Black Sheep Or Two|+2|In general, the individual's family is upstanding, but one or more members of the family are known to be disreputable.|
|15-18|Mostly Bad|-2|The individual's family is treated in general with contempt, but occasionally a family member has demonstrated positive qualities and earned respect.|
|19-20|Bad|-3|Others treat the individual's family with contempt and every member is assumed to be disreputable.|

#### Family Political Views

Politics plays a big role in every family. Even in a quiet kingdom with a beloved monarch, the individual's family may have a strong and avowed commitment to supporting the ruler and his/her family. A sense of discord with the current system can create any number of really interesting background details for both the Player and the GM to use.

Table 5-29: Family Political Views, below, is used to determine the political views of the individual's family.

###### Table 5-29: Family Political Views

|d20|Political Views|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-3|Apolitical|The individual's family has no specific political stance.|
|4-6|Supportive|The individual's family supports the current political structure and rulers.|
|7-8|Enfranchised|The individual's family is a part of the system and supports it.|
|9|Enfranchised Progressive|The individual's family is a part of the system but is open to suggestions for change.|
|10|Enfranchised Radical|The individual's family is a part of the system but is actively seeking to change the system.|
|11-13|Loyal Opposition|The individual's family supports the current political structure but favours a change of rulers.|
|14-15|Dissatisfied|The individual's family is unhappy with current political structure but satisfied the current rulers are at least doing no real harm.|
|16|Dissident|The individual's family is secretly supporting a rebellion or movement to overthrow the political system or the existing rulers.|
|17-18|Radical|The individual's family is in open revolt against the current system and existing rulers.|
|19-20|Mixed|One part of the individual's family supports the current system and/or rulers and other faction is actively working to replace or remove that system and/or rulers.|

#### Family Power Structure

How does the individual's family organise itself? Most families have some form of structure, even if it is only the "respect" of a child for a parent. The more complex the family business or intrigues, the more detailed the family power structure should become.

Table 5-30: Family Power Structure, below, is used to determine the political views of the individual's family.

###### Table 5-30: Family Power Structure

|d20|Power Structure|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-2|Unorganised|The individual's family has no internal organisation. Family members are responsible for their own actions.|
|3-6|Elders|The oldest members control the individual's family.|
|7-8|Patriarchy|The male members control the individual's family.|
|9-10|Matriarchy|The female members control the individual's family.|
|11-12|Oligarchy|The richest members control the individual's family.|
|13-14|Meritocracy|The members with the most talent (usually ability in the family business) control the individual's family.|
|15-18|Divided|One branch of the family follows one leadership structure and one or more others follow a different structure.|
|19|External|The individual's family is lead by an outsider; liege lord or other person to whom the family has sworn support.|
|20|Domination|A violent or dangerous family member rules the individual's family through fear.|

#### Ancestry

Every family has its favoured sons, gifted daughters and crazy aunts and uncles. Table 5-31: Ancestry, below, uses the term "ancestor" because it's likely that these well-known people aren't around to influence the Jäger's career directly. But with the GM's approval, there's no reason you can't simply substitute "family member" for "ancestor" anywhere on this table.

Ancestry is more than a list of ancestors. It includes properties and goods that have been handed down from generation to generation, traditional alliances and feuds and notable deeds, both respected and infamous, of past generations. The ancestry generated here, however, is only the bare bones.

Every ancestor generated should prompt you to write a one or two-sentence description of who that person was and why they matter to the individual's family. This information does not need to include a complete Jäger template, just enough data for the GM to use as hooks for an adventure and for you to have interesting stories to tell about the individual's family.

###### Table 5-31: Ancestry

|d20|Result|Family Honour|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-3|None|+0|-|
|4|Criminal|-5|One of the family's recent ancestors was a notorious condemned criminal (horse thief, murderer, etc). This is an awful blot on the family honour.|
|5|Mountain, Small|+0|The family holds the title to land. Mountain land is poor and unsuitable for cultivation, although lumber may be taken from it. Such land can support only a single family (2d4 Gold Mark/Luna Income).|
|6|Roll Again|+0|Roll again, using next higher die or +10.|
|7-8|Farm, Small|+1|The family holds the title to land. A small farm can support 1-2 families (2d8 Gold Mark/Luna Income).|
|9|Traditional Business|+1|One branch of the family runs a tradition business of some kind (2d6 Gold Mark/Luna Income).|
|10|Roll Again|+0|Roll again, using next higher die or +10.|
|11|Forgotten|+0|The individual's family's ancestors of note are unknown or forgotten. Information about them could be revealed in a future adventure, however.|
|12-15|Farm, Modest|+1|The family holds the title to land. A moderate farm can support 2-3 families (3d8 Gold Mark/Luna Income).|
|16-19|Town, Small|+2|The family holds the title to land. A small town could mean the family controls a village or a few blocks of a large town (2d10+20 Gold Mark/Luna Income).|
|20|Roll Again|+0|Roll again, using next higher die or +10.|
|21-24|None|+0|-|
|25-26|Advantageous Marriage|+2|In the recent past the family managed to arrange a marriage between one of its daughters and a man 1-3 Social Standings higher. The family is now related by marriage to a higher Social Standing.|
|27-31|Ancestral Alliance|+1|The family has a long-term friendship with another family of roughly the same Social Standing. You determine the family, with the GM's approval. A +4 modifier is applied to NPC encounter reactions between the families.|
|32-35|Ancestral Feud|+1|The family has a long-standing blood feud with another family of approximately the same Social Standing. You determine the family, with the GM's approval. A -8 modifier is applied to NPC encounter reactions between the families. Poor reactions lead to insults, duels or attacks.|
|36-38|None|+0|-|
|39|Brilliant Artisan|+2|The family produced a craftsman noted for his exceptionally fine work.|
|40-42|Castle, Small|+3|One of the family groups holds the deed to a castle or similar property (a barbarian clan might control some natural stronghold or semi-permanent camp). This includes the fighting men needed to garrison the castle and guard the commoners who live nearby and serve the lord of the castle.|
|43-44|Castle, Large|+3|As a small castle, only bigger.|
|45|Classic Artist|+2|One of the family's distant ancestors was an artist whose work is now considered to be classic in its field.|
|46|Curse|-3|An ancestral curse haunts the family, perhaps as a result of some great Evil done by the family in the past. It may be a haunting by a vengeful spirit, a tendency for the men to be killed young, etc. The curse is well-known to all. It has no effect on the everyday life of family members and does not directly affect the Jäger. However, the need to perform some deed to lift the curse can be the basis for an exciting adventure.|
|47-49|None|+0|-|
|50|Defeated Family|-3|The family was once large and powerful, but was defeated in a great struggle for power. This defeat results in lasting dishonour to the family and/or clan. The family automatically has an ancestral feud with the victorious family (determined by the player with the GM's approval). In addition, the family has ancestral alliances with any other defeated families.|
|51-54|Estate, Small|+2|The family holds the deed to an estate. This includes control of the peasants who work the land, warriors to defend it and an appropriately styled dwelling for the owner. For Barbarian Jägers, an estate can also be the control of a large herd of animals (2d10 Gold Mark/Luna Income).|
|55-56|Estate, Large|+2|As a small estate (2d10+20 Gold Mark/Luna Income).|
|57|Famous General|+3|An ancestor of the family is remembered for his heroic deeds in war. The ancestor is venerated and respected by the family and is known to others.|

|69|False Hero|+3|An ancestor made up a story (commonly accepted as fact) about completing a great quest, recovering an artefact or killing a terrible monster or villain.|
|70|Folk Hero|+3|A distant ancestor was a hero and defender of the common people. The commoners remember this and the family gains a +2 modifier on encounter reactions with NPC commoners.|
|71|Great Betrayal|-7|A distant ancestor attempted (and failed) in an act of great treachery to his lord. His name is only spoken in evil tones.|
|72|Great Hero|+5|A distant ancestor was a hero renowned in folklore and legend. All of his deeds were magnificent (especially as the stories were told again and again) and he has come to represent the heroic ideal. His name, family and deeds are known to all.|
|73-77|None|+0|-|
|78|Royal Bloodline|+4|The family can trace some blood connection to a royal house (or the highest ruler of the land). Although extremely tenuous, the family can claim some right to the throne. This doesn't mean anyone in the family will ever reach this position, since there are many more claimants with better bloodlines (such as the ruler's children).|
|79-80|Infamous General/Minister|-2|The family managed to produce a military or political leader noted for his venality, bungling, stupidity or corruption. Since he reached high position, his evils or failures are well known to all.|
|81-85|None|+0|-|

|88-91|Merchant Fleet|+1|Some branch of the family has a successful trading business. It owns 2-5 ships (caravans in land-locked areas) and appropriate warehouses. It also hires men to serve as sailors (or teamsters), guards, clerks, etc (2d10+20 Gold Mark/Luna Income).|
|92-93|Notorious Moneylender|-2|A recent ancestor made a good living loaning money (usually at exorbitant interest) to local people. This gave the family a bad reputation, but greater wealth. The Jäger is automatically entitled to an extra roll on .|
|94-96|Hereditary Title|+2|The head of the family holds a hereditary title of respect or nobility. When he dies, it will pass to his son.|
|97|Roll Again|+0|Roll again, adding +10.|
|98|Secret Society|+0|The family has long-standing connections with a secret society. The GM will determine the exact purpose of the society. This is not known to anyone outside the family and the society members. It does provide the Jäger with contacts inside this society.|
|99|Tragic Event|+1|Some sad event has occurred to a distant ancestor be it in love, war or business. However, the nobility of the ancestor's suffering has actually increased the honour of the family. Such events usually find their way into folk-tales, dramas or songs.|
|100|God-Touched|+3|The individual's family is rumoured to have produced an ancestor who ascended to godhood or had meaningful contact with the gods in some way.|

### Education

No one is a trained Fighter or Wizard from birth. Someone taught the individual how to swing that sword, pick that lock or perform that religious ceremony. The following tables help you learn what the individual's education was like before the day he began adventuring.

#### Early Childhood Instruction

All Jägers learn some basic skills as children. This instruction may provide a direction for their later interests and careers. Table 5-32: Childhood Education, below, tells where the individual focused as a child - his favourite subject. Keep in mind that the individual's skill selection should reflect his childhood education.

###### Table 5-32: Childhood Education

|d20|Childhood Education|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-4|Outdoors|The individual learned basic wilderness survival skills.|
|4-8|Book Learning|The individual learned how to read and write.|
|9-11|Religious|The individual learned the religious beliefs of his community or family. Perhaps he embraced them or perhaps he rejected them.|

|16-17|Multicultural|The individual travelled or moved enough to learn that the world is a big place with many different people and places.|
|18-19|Business/Politics|The individual was curious about money or government.|
|20|Magic|The individual showed an affinity for the arcane arts.|

#### Formal Education

Most families that can afford it make sure their children get some formal schooling. Sometimes this education is a part of an apprenticeship program or it may be a natural outgrowth of helping with the family business.

Table 5-33: Formal Education, below, is used to determine the formal education of the individual.

###### Table 5-33: Formal Education

|d20|Formal Education|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-5|Agriculture|The individual learned farming and animal husbandry techniques.|
|6|History|The individual learned basic local or national history.|

|18-19|School Of Hard Knocks|The individual's time on the street taught him minor thievery and con games.|
|20|Magic|The individual studied "defences against the dark arts" and learned ways to fight monsters and battle the influence of black magic.|

#### Learning A Trade

For most Jägers, the idea of becoming an Jäger starts as a dream. Instead, most Jägers are apprenticed to a trade, inducted into the religious or military order, brought into the family business, sent to the fields or given some other task-related instruction. This is all determined by Table 5-34: Learning A Trade, below.

###### Table 5-34: Learning A Trade

|d20|Trade|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-4|Farmer|The individual helped plant, weed and harvest a crop.|
|5-6|Hunter/Trapper|The individual spent time seeking animal skins or meat in the wilderness.|
|7-8|Craft|The individual learned a craft (any of the categories possible for the Craft skill).|
|9-10|Religious|The individual had advanced studies in a formal church setting. Includes training as an acolyte or special functionary for religious practice.|
|11-12|Politics|The individual was apprenticed to a political or bureaucratic functionary.|
|13-14|Healing|The individual learned the skills of a healer or herbalist.|
|15|Specialised|The individual learned an unusual trade such as bookkeeping or the law.|
|16-17|Military Training|Commoners typically become infantry or archers and those with higher social status become staff officers or squires.|
|18|Special Military Training|Examples include artillery, armourer, scout, aide de camp and logistics.|
|19|Monastery/Knightly Order|The individual has been accepted for training by an order of monks or knights.|
|20|Anarchist|The individual has been apprenticed to a Wizard or Wu Jen for arcane instruction.|

### Life Events (Thus Far)

Life isn't just training for a profession of course. Think of your own life and all the events - good and bad - you've lived through. It's likely that the Jäger, growing up in a fantastic, dangerous world, has had at least that many triumphs and tragedies.

#### Early Childhood Events

Some events in early childhood have lasting impacts on an Jäger's future development. Table 5-35: Childhood Events, below, is used to determine the early childhood events that influenced the individual.

###### Table 5-35: Childhood Events

|d20|Event|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-3|Survived Childhood Danger|Perhaps the individual was menaced by a dangerous creature or kidnapped by raiders.|
|4-6|Survived Major Danger To Community|Flood, famine, plague or another calamity struck when the individual was a child.|
|7-9|Undertook A Long Journey|This could be a one-way or two-way trip. The player decides where the individual went and why (with the GM's approval).|
|10-11|Witness|The individual saw a horrible crime or violent event.|
|12|Astronomical Event|The individual was born under a strange moon, a comet in the sky or some other phenomenon.|
|13|Personal Epiphany|The individual had an earth-shaking brush with greatness, such as meeting a king or being contacted directly by a god.|
|14-15|Became A Refugee|War or some other disaster ruined the individual's community.|
|16-17|Death In The Family|The individual lost a parent or other significant family member.|
|18-19|Illness|The individual contracted a lingering sickness or developed a congenital defect.|
|20|Injury Or Physical Defect|This can range from burns and scars to more serious defects.|

#### Youth Events

Many Jägers get their first sense of the wide world they live in during their teenage Turnings. Table 5-36: Youth Events, below, is used to determine what exciting or heartbreaking events were the highlights of the individual.

###### Table 5-36: Youth Events

|d20|Event|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-3|Battle|The individual aided in the defence of his community against raiders or a marauding monster.|
|4-5|Adventure|The individual participated in a minor adventure such as building a homestead or working on a caravan on a new route.|
|6-7|Politics|Perhaps the individual spoke on behalf of a political movement or candidate or stood up to an abuse of authority.|
|8-10|Great Romance|Lingering effects may include a jilted lover or a current relationship - and a reputation for boorishness or tenderness.|
|11-12|Religion|The individual served his faith in a minor capacity, perhaps with a minor vow or oath.|
|13-14|Arcane|The individual displayed an innate talent for arcane Hexcasting or an affinity for Magic. Perhaps others took notice or maybe he kept it a secret.|
|15-16|Healing|The individual cared for a recovering family member or hero.|
|17-19|Crime|The individual broke the law. Either he got caught and suffered some form of punishment or he learned how to dodge the consequences and survive.|
|20|Discovery|The individual found a unique aptitude or talent such as extremely keen vision or a knack for ventriloquism.|

#### Pivotal Events

Some events are so significant that they change the entire course of a Jäger's life. These events are not necessarily tied to a specific age or experience level but might occur at any time. For many, Table 5-37: Pivotal Events, below, represents the last significant thing that happened to their Jäger before the first adventure begins.

###### Table 5-37: Pivotal Events

|d20|Event|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-11|None|Table 6-35: Childhood Events and Table 6-36: Youth Events cover the most dramatic aspects of the individual‘s past.|
|12-13|Refugee|As a result of some calamity, the individual was forced to become a displaced person.|
|14|Cultural Shift|A large, cohesive group moves to the individual's home community, creating friction with the existing community. As a result, he's exposed to a new culture and new challenges. The GM will have some ideas on exactly who the new population is and why they arrived.|
|15|Under Siege|Attacks from organised raiders menace the community over a substantial period of time.|
|16|Climactic Battle|A significant monster or villain threatens the community and is eventually either destroyed or driven off.|
|17|All-Out War|An armed conflict engulfs the individual's community. This can be a traditional war, a revolution or an invasion by a monstrous host.|
|18-19|Community Crisis|This includes structural problems like earthquake, climate shifts, famine and repeated waves of plague.|
|20|Religious Awakening|A new faith is created, a schism tears an existing faith apart or a prophecy is announced, for example.|

### Relationships

Next we'll turn our attention away from events and toward people. By populating the Jäger's world with interesting family, friends and enemies, you make the world seem more real and you give the GM all kinds of tools to make adventures more exciting. Perhaps the individual's sister gets kidnapped. Or maybe his uncle is now the captain of the watch and he'll let him sneak into the tower if he can get a certain flower for his wife...

#### Birth Circumstances

No man is an island. Likewise, no Jäger is truly an individual. He's the product of countless generations of individuals that came before him. Table 5-38: Birth Order, Table 5-39: Birth Circumstances, and Table 5-40: Illegitimate Birth Circumstances (all below) will help to determine the circumstances of the Jäger's birth.

Roll on Table 5-38: Birth Order twice. If either roll is 01-02 then the birth circumstances of the individual is Unknown. Otherwise, the lower of the two rolls is the birth order of the Jäger and the higher roll gives the total
number of children in the family.

Add the modifier from Table 5-41: Birth Racial Modifiers, to Table 5-38: Birth Order. A roll may NOT be modified to below 03 i.e. a modified roll below 03 is treated as 03. A roll of 01-02 can not be modified i.e. a roll of 01-02 is ALWAYS a result of Unknown.

If the Jäger's Birth Circumstances are Unknown, then all of the tables refer to the community where the Jäger was raised. Skip to , below, in this case, as the GM will determine the details about your birth family.

###### Table 5-38: Birth Order

|d%|Circumstances|
|:-:|:-:|
|01-02|Unknown|
|03-10|First Child|
|11-20|Second Child|
|21-35|Third Child|
|36-50|Forth Child|
|51-65|Fifth Child|
|66-80|Sixth Child|
|81-85|Seventh Child|
|86-90|Eighth Child|
|91-94|Ninth Child|
|95-97|Tenth Child|
|98-99|Eleventh Child|
|00|Twelfth Child|

###### Table 5-39: Birth Circumstances

|d%|Circumstances|
|:-:|:--|
|1-80|Legitimate|
|81-00|Illegitimate. Use Table 5-40 Illegitimate Birth Circumstances.|

- Add the modifier from Table 5-41: Birth Racial Modifiers this table.

It is possible to develop an entire family tree using Table 5-38: Birth Order through to Table 5-41: Birth Racial Modifiers. Once you have determined how many siblings are in each generation, determine their sex randomly (1d6: 1-3 Male, 4-6 Female), then simply work out the birth order of both parents and then all four grandparents, etc. Children of the individual's father's or mother's siblings will obviously be the individual's cousins. Any sibling with the same Birth Order as another is obviously a twin (or triplet, etc). Assume anyone in the age category of Young Adult or older has an 80% of being
married. Use , and to help.

###### Table 5-40: Illegitimate Birth Circumstances

|d20|Personal Honour|Circumstances|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1|+0|Jäger was abandoned at birth. Treat as a roll of 01-02 on .|
|2-6|-3|Mother was a prostitute. Father unknown. Social Standing -20.|
|7-12|-2|Birth was result of a rape. 50% chance father is known.|
|13-18|-1|Birth was result of adulterous affair. 75% chance father is known.|
|19-20|-1|Birth was arranged through a surrogate mother. 25% chance birth mother known.|

- The figure found in the Jäger Honour Column should be added to the Jäger's Starting Honour (see Chapter X - Honour Fame And Oaths).

###### Table 5-41: Birth Racial Modifiers

|Race|Modifier|
|:--|:-:|
|Dwarf - All|-15|
|Elf - Amazonian|-30/+50\|
|Elf - Dark|-15|
|Elf - High|-20|
|Elf - Wood|-10|
|Gnome - All|-20|
|Halfling - All|-10|
|Half-Elf|-10|
|Half-Orc|+20|
|Hengeyokai|-20|
|Human - All|+0|
|Korobokuru|-15|
|Spirit Folk - All|+0|

- For Amazonian Elves, add the number before the slash to Table 5-38: Birth Order and the number after the slash to Table 5-39: Birth Circumstances. Amazonian Elves never roll on 5-40: Illegitimate Birth Circumstancesas Illegitimate children are the norm, with no social stigma.


###### Table 5-42: Birthrights Birth Order Modifiers

|Birth Order|Modifier|
|:--|:-:|
|First Born|+10|
|Second Born|+5|
|Third Born|+1|
|Second-Last Born (Only if not 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> Born)|-5|
|Last Born (Only if not 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> or 3<sup>rd</sup> Born)|-10|

#### Parents

Probably the most important basic relationship an Jäger has is with his parents. Table 5-43: Parents, below, has the details.

###### Table 5-43: Parents

|d20|Parent Status|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-11|Two Living Parents|Both are alive and healthy.        |
|12-13|One Living Parent|The player chooses which one is alive and how the other one passed away.|
|14|Both Parents Dead|The player chooses the circumstances.|
|15-18|One Ill|One parent has a long term illness or infirmity.|
|19-20|Both Ill|Both parents have a long term illness or infirmity.|

#### Grandparents

Many Humans have living grandparents. In the longer-lived races, grandparents or great-grandparents are even more common. You should decide how many of the Jäger's elders are still a part of the Jäger's life. Check Table 5-44: Grandparents, below, for details.

###### Table 5-44: Grandparents

|d20|Grandparent Status|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-2|No Grandparents|The individual remembers them, but they have passed away.|
|3|Mother's Parents Alive|Father's parents are deceased.|
|4|Father's Parents Alive|Mother's parents are deceased.|
|5-6|One Grandparent On Each Side|The player chooses which ones.|
|7|Three Grandparents Alive|The player chooses which ones.|
|8|Great-Grandparent Alive|At least one, maybe more. Make a note of how many and who they are. Roll again to check on your grandparents.|
|9-10|Grandparents Unknown|They died before the individual was old enough to remember them.|

#### Extended Family

Table 5-45: Extended Family, below, includes uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews, links by marriage, links broken by marriage dissolution, etc. The tangle of familial relationships can be as detailed or as simple as you desire.

###### Table 5-45: Extended Family

|d20|Extended Family|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-2|None|You have no living relatives beyond the ones you've already created.|
|3-4|No Known Relatives|You have other relatives out there somewhere, but you don't know who or how many.|
|5-11|Few Living Relatives|You have 1d10 living relatives.|
|12-18|Many Living Relatives|You have 2d12 living relatives.|
|19-20|Huge Extended Family|You know dozens of relatives of various generations.|

#### Friends

These friends might actually be other heroes that the Jäger will adventure with or they may be NPCs for the GM to use for mood, setting or plot. In any event, create as many or as few as you feel necessary, in as much detail as you wish (at least one roll). Table 5-46: Friends, below, is used to determine the friends of the individual.

###### Table 5-46: Friends

|d20|Friends|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-3|No Friends|The individual is a loner by choice or circumstance.|
|4-6|Lost|A significant friend is dead or missing.|
|7-10|Few|The individual doesn't make friends easily, but he's a good friend to them. He has a few close friends.|
|11-16|Some|The individual has several friends who are companions or associates but who aren't intimately close to him.|
|16-20|Many|The individual has light and pleasant relationships with many people but few if any significant ties.|

#### Instructors

Many people form strong bonds with teachers, mentors, superior officers, etc. For the purpose of this table, we'll call them instructors. This relationship provides not only excellent basis for creating NPCs, but also suggests what your Class might be. Once you've checked this table, make a note of your instructor's name, location, etc and decide whether your instructor is still alive.

Table 5-47: Instructors, below, is used to determine the instructors of the individual.

###### Table 5-47: Instructors

|d20|Instructors|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-3|No Instructors Of Note|Either they were forgettable or the individual taught himself.|
|4-8|Basic|A particularly good instructor taught the individual the basic skills (choose alive or dead, note NPC details).|
|9-10|Advanced|A top-notch instructor taught the individual more advanced military, religious or arcane techniques|
|11|Angry|The individual has angered or otherwise alienated an instructor of note.|
|12|Vanished|The instructor who taught the individual everything he knows has vanished.|
|13|Favour|A favourite instructor of note has requested an oath or service from the individual (describe the oath or service).|
|14-16|Unrelated|The person who taught the individual the most isn't actually in the individual's area of expertise.|
|17-18|Lower Social Standing|As above, but the instructor is much lower Social Standing than the individual is.|
|19|Other Race|The individual's favourite instructor of note is of a different race than the individual (choose one).|
|20|Exotic|The instructor of note is exotic (non-humanoid, outsider, etc).|

#### Enemies

Enemies, from local bullies to major villains, can shape an individual's life as much as his more positive relationships. At the least, a good set of enemies provides the GM with an excellent foil for heroic adventures! This is another table you can roll on more than once, if you want.

Table 5-48: Enemies, below, is used to determine the enemies of the individual.

###### Table 5-48: Enemies

|d20|Enemies|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-3|No Enemies|Yet!|
|4-5|Minor Childhood Enemy|Someone harbours a grudge or a prejudice against the individual but has no current basis for the antagonism.|
|6|Jilted Lover|The individual wronged someone in a matter of the heart.|
|7|Jilted Lover's Friend Or Relative|Someone harbours ill feelings for the individual due to the individual's actions toward a loved one.|
|8|Romantic Rival|The individual edged someone out in some affair of the heart and they hold a grudge.|
|9-10|Enemy Of The Family|The individual's family has earned the enmity of a person, group or opposing family.|
|11|The Enemy Of My Friend Is My Enemy|One of the individual's friends has an enemy and now that person hates him, too.|
|12|Social Rival|The individual wronged someone (either actually or only in that person's imagination) in a social or business context.|
|13|Villain|One or more local villains have chosen to direct their hatred toward the individual, perhaps because of some minor adventure he completed.|
|14|Monster|One or more local monsters view the individual as a threat, perhaps as a result of some minor encounter.|
|15|Alignment Enemy|A person of an opposed Alignment has a philosophical beef with the individual.|
|16|Political Enemy|A noble, officer or other high-ranking official looks on the individual with disfavour, maybe due to the individual's lack of manners (real or perceived) or because he inadvertently spoiled the enemy's secret plans.|
|17|Arcane Rival|A fellow apprentice or student of the arcane arts develops an intense dislike for the individual. Perhaps he was the instructor's favourite.|
|18|Diabolic Enemy|A Demon, Devil or other powerful outsider identifies the individual as a current or future threat.|
|19|Enemy Within|Someone in the individual's family hates and fears him, either openly or secretly.|
|20|Imaginary Foe|The individual falsely believe that someone is out to get him.|

### Birthrights

The final factor in determining an individual's pre-history is to determine the individual's inheritance or birthrights. The number of rolls to take and the die to use on Table 5-49: Birthrights, below, are found on . Note that the modifiers listed on Table 5-42: Birthrights Birth Order Modifiers, above, must be added to each roll.

###### Table 5-49: Birthrights

|Roll|Birthright|Personal Honour|Details|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--|
|1-3|None|+0|No Inheritance|
